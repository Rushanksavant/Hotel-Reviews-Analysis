"The hotel was adequate for my stay. The strips in the bathtub were useless as I fell while taking a shower. I asked the front desk staff several times to get a bath mat but they never did. Management was unresponsive to my request which was very poor; someone should have gone to a dollar store and gotten a bath mat. Breakfast was good but it would have been nice to have had yogurt and/or cottage cheese on the buffet.

"It was great for what we needed, a place to sleep. Parking was 20 a day, which isn�t too bad for that area. We were on the floor that the pool was located on, so there was a constant flow of loud people storming down the hallway. Poorly set up, since that is the only way to the pool. They probably put us there since we used a third party booking site.

"The room is tiny. The building is old and worn on inside. Needs updating. The walls are thin. The bathroom needs updating. Flooring is worn and ripping. Staff wasn�t the friendliest. Plan on walking 25 minutes to time square. Security was the only good thing with this hotel. Be prepared they add on fees if you purchase through Expedia. They call it resort fees. Why, I have no idea. It�s not a resort.

Worst of all the assistant I had was horrible at service. She was rude and unattentive. Felt rushed and she didn't try to give us any information at all about the hotel except where our room is at. They only accept strictly Debit cards and some major credit cards only with a $50-100 dollars deposit depending on if you have kids or not with you. If only the attendant that helped me was more friendly I wouldn't mind so much all the other flaws... But in all honesty I didn't even get a smile from her and I booked 4 rooms. But I'm not saying all employees are like that but I can say I never gotten any kind of acknowledgement from any of the employees who works there. No one greets.

The room smelled musty, the AC was loud and frequently went on and off, almost no sound proofing between the door and outside so heard every child or pool activity. Overall the room I'd say was nothing more then a new paint job.

"The property is in a nice neighborhood with restaurants, retail shopping and easy access to public transportation. The facility was only about twenty minutes from LaGuardia airport which was convenient after a long day of travel. The hotel was clean and check in was easy with the staff. They ran out of room card so we only had one during our stay which was fine because we were together coming and going. They did tell us to check back in the morning after our check in but we didn�t check back. 
 
 We had a king size bed in our room which was very comfortable. The bathroom was small as you had to wedge yourself in the corner to shut or open the door but the shower was nice and the sink area as well. The mirror also lit up without the main light as well which was a nice feature. 
 
 Nice flat screen tv mounted on the wall and a wardrobe provided because there wasn�t a closet. We made use of a corner in the room for our large luggage and had plenty of cubby holes for clothing and shoes. 
 
 Breakfast was also provided every morning which was a great way to start the day not having to worry about food for a good part of the day. The only negative was that it was the same foods everyday in a buffet style. 
 
 Overall for the price, room features, neighborhood location and breakfast I would stay here again. I really liked that there wasn�t carpet on the floor either.

When I booked the 2 rooms 1 for my family and 1 for my Aunt and Uncle it says we are getting a King size bed but when we got in our rooms it appears to be a Queen size bed, both rooms. Then trying to use the phone in our room but its not working and I have to go to my Aunt's room to use there phone then I have to wait for them to ring me back but I decided to go down to the front desk then they told me that it is a King size bed and also they told me they can't transfer us because they are fully book. The rooms are both accessible and very spacious. It looks clean but I have seen some water stain in the ceiling. We slept alright its comfortable enough. Staff are friendly.

However, there are some hotel features which are not the best. The rooms are extremely small. I went with my boyfriend so overall it was fine but it was already a small room for the two of us. They didn't clean the room very well. Also, we were on the 30th floor and to wait for the elevators was a complete nightmare. One day we had to spent 15 minutes waiting for an elevator with enough space to be able to go down and then another day we had to wait 30 minutes in the lobby to be able to go up. The elevators need major improvement since they are really slow and they are always crowded.

"Our first room was basically in the parking lot. It was incredibly loud until about 1am and then again beginning at 5am. We barely got any sleep. This was due not only to location, but mostly due to the fact that the seal of the door was non-existent. We could see light all the way around it. They did let us change rooms. This new room was in a better location, but was still very loud. Also, as soon as you check in they try to con you into a timeshare. We also had dried blood stains on our comforter. We could not wait until check-out. I mean this hotel is cheaper than others in the area, but it was a terrible experience. Not worth the savings!!!!

Be ready to literally walk sideways to get to the bed, if you are in a two bed room. Same story in the bathroom. An irritatingthing was that there was no place to put the soap while showering. Maybe they wany to just put it on the floor. Had a less than basic free breakfast in a dingy basement.

"Walkable from Disney park and free parking. Property was big and small enough to manage from going from your vehicle to the lobby and up to the room with young kids. Free coffee amenities were great. Would ask if they can update the color of their closets to make it more welcoming to keep your belongings in. It was dark and out dated looking. Would definitely stay here again.

"The Wyndham has gone back. The room was awful. The toilet kept breaking and on the last day they decided to turn off the water mid way through a shower without notifying the guests. In addition a cockroach was also seen in the bath tub. Around the pool it�s pretty much look after yourself. There is no one coming round taking drink orders and there is no amenity to blow up your child�s floaty. The surface of the pool is in need of some TLC. I have stayed here so many times but this will be my last time as the hotel has seriously gone back. The breakfast is very basic and you constantly have to remind the servers about your breakfast order. We asked for an omelette and 20 mins later it was still not out and then when it finally did it was the wrong one. Just not good enough.

I asked for a manager as i had traveled according to check in! She waived the resort fee, which was nice but for the amount of money being spent to stay at your resort this should not have been an issue whatsoever, to top it off I was told delayed possibly 30 minutes however i didn�t receive a call until 6:00pm notifying me of that my room had become available! 1hour and half after the expected Time giving! We were celebrating my Dtrs 6th Birthday due to the fact that we didn�t check in until 6:00 by the time we got our bags out and situated to change and made it down stairs to start exploring it�s started to storm and of course bc of this the pools are closed down bummer so our first night we spent in the room??Not Happy Travelers!

At Check in their system over authorized my credit card by a big amount (according to an Uber driver this happens a lot in Orlando), however, Ashley S brought to my attention and took care of it immediately she was very apologetic and took necessary steps to make sure it didn't happen again. I was given 2 breakfast buffet coupons & compted 1 day for resort fee. As far as room being cleaned daily housekeeping needs help, never consistent with leaving towels, toilet paper, no vacuuming, didn't empty trash 1 day. I wouldn't choose to stay here again, its more for families with children as there was plenty of activities for kidos.

"I really liked this hotel and will probably book there again. Amenities are awesome, overall hotel is very nice, the reason i reviewed as i did was because when we arrived, the hotel staff told us that they overbooked and we were going to have to be moved from room to room in the middle of our stay. With children, that sucks. But we didn�t have a choice. We booked so long in advance there was no way another hotel would be the same price and the area was pretty sold out. So we bit the bullet. BUT the next morning we went downstairs and the staff at the counter had no idea what we were talking about, then informed us that there were no other rooms to move us to, which is great! It was just an inconvenience we had to stay packed for a day thinking we�d be moving rooms and then when addressed no one knew what we were talking about. Also, breakfast at the Summit restaurant in the same parking lot. We got the continental and it was just fruit and a fruit pastry. I paid for a different breakfast but it was ridiculously priced. If we weren�t staying at the hotel, two bowls of fruit, two pastries, two plates of biscuits and gravy would have been $65!!! Luckily it was not that much since we were staying there. So, other than that miscommunication at the front. The hotel was one of the nicer ones we�ve ever stayed in with our kids.

Hay que tener en cuenta que el mismo edificio alberga distintos tipos de alojamientos a distintos precios (incluyendo albergues para joven) aunque los distintos huespedes nunca se mezclan en la misma planta pero le da al conjunto un ambiente peculiar. La limpieza es impecables en las habitaciones y la ubicaci�n es inmejorable.

"Please read the fine print BEFORE choosing this hotel. Yes its close to Disney Springs, but you dont get much for the money you spend. While the pool is nice, the rooms are oit dated and dirty. Dont bother ordering room service and if your a soda drinker, BRING YOUR OWN!!! last night i ordered a meal to split between myself and my young daughter. I splurged a bit and got the steak and potatoes. They asked what drink we wanted. I ordered a pepsi and a sprite. To my surprise, a CAN NOT BOTTLE was $5.00 A PIECE! Which meant $10.00 for two cans of soda... TALK ABOUT ROBBERY. The steak I ordered was $32, but once the cokes were added plus 18% for them walking it up, our bill for one plated meal was $61.00. >< The bus transport they offer to the parks is ridiculous and the drivers are rude(even to children) and they are always late. They also leave when people are walking/running up flagging them down to wait. (Saw this on multiple occasions during our three day stay) 
 Nothing in this hotel is disney themed other than the ""store"" down stairs. Oh! And the fees to stay here are outrageous. $25 a night resort fee, but you also HAVE to pay $20 a day to park your car, even if you park it. So for three nights, we had to pay, $75 in resort fees and $60 to park our car. $135 on top of what we paid for the room which was a little over $350 bucks. We could have just stayed on actual property and had a nice room with kind bus drivers for that price, but live and learn i guess. LIVID.

That being said, we have stayed at several properties local to the parks over the years but this was our first time at this hotel. It will NOT be our last! In fact, this will be our go to hotel from here on out. From great rates compared to other area hotels (we paid $151 when other hotels were charging $199+ for the same night), to brand new and supremely clean facilities (lobby, pool, and room), to free parking, no resort fee, and excellent customer service from Stacy and her team. We WILL be back. Highly recommend it! The whole property is newly renovated. The rooms were clean and large. We had 2 queens and a pull out couch with a view of the pool. We used the pool which was heated. The pool area was clean and well stocked with towels. There is gated underground parking and we were able to leave our car in the garage as we enjoyed the parks after check out and returned to get our vehicle around 10pm. We walked to Garden Walk for dinner as well as to and from Disneyland. We were greeted each time by every employee we encountered. Definitely will plan on using this hotel as our Disney spot from here on out.

 Very unpleased with Expedia for having images of the renovated rooms and giving us the old rooms, I feel that I�ve been purchasing packages with Expedia and should at least gotten a better room. This hasn�t been the first time this has happened to me and my family.

"The location and cleanliness was the best thing about this Hotel. But you better make sure the breakfast is included in your stay. If not, you will pay an outrageous price for the food that was not that good for the price.
 The air-condition went out, and they said they would send a service man to reset it, but he never showed up to the room. We had to crack the door to let the cold air from the hall try to cool down the room. I was not the only person that had issues with this problem.
 I have sent an email to who the manager gave me the email address, and no reply whatsoever! That tells me they don�t really care about the customers!
 At this point, I would not recommend this Hotel to any of my friends going to New York. The price was way too high for the service we received.

"Checked into our room and 5pm and immediately left to go shopping turning the AC on before we left to cool the room down. Got back around midnight to find the room was still 78 degrees. First we thought maybe we set the AC wrong and gave it 20 minutes to see if it would cool down. After the wait time , the temp had increased by 2 degrees and was now over 80. We called the front desk and told them of the situation. They had a maintenance guy come up to the room who was instantly able to tell that the AC was broke?(no room check before guest check in ?) he said he would be able to fix it but it would take some time and as it was already 1am and we had just drove 17 hours we were very tired and just wanted to sleep so we asked to switch rooms. We were then forced to pack all of our belongings that we had just unpacked a few hours earlier and lug all of our luggage to the front desk lobby to switch rooms.by this point it was almost 2am and we were given a new room with a working AC unit and weren�t able to get settled into our room til about 230am.

The setup of the room furniture was nice. Had power strips velcroed to the nightstand which was handy just strange for a hotel. Room smelled musty, wallpaper was coming off the walls, plumbing (toilet, sink, and shower) would back up and had low water pressure. It looked like some parts of the hotel had been renovated but maybe just not the room where I was staying. There was some fragrance in the sheets that made my skin itch?

"First, let me start off by saying that I have NEVER liked this cheap looking hotel. I was there in 2003, and my keycard kept deactivating on its own. Now, in 2019, it did it again. I see you haven't upgraded. But this is not about the keycard. This is about your silly ""Facility Fee."" Exactly, WHAT FACILITIES did I use??? The toilet? I was under the impression that that was covered in the regular hotel fee! We got no complimentary coffee. No hair dryer in our room. No complimentary breakfast in the lobby either. So what did my facility fee cover? That was never explained. The only thing we ""used"" was the bed, bathroom and tv, which comes with any hotel room, and should be included in the price of the hotel. Those shouldn't be considered as, ""extras"" or ""facility fees."" Moreover, Expedia advertises this scummy hotel as having free WIFI. Hmmm. So if that's part of the facility fee, then it's NOT FREE! I've been to NY LOTS of times. No hotel has ever charged this ridiculous fee! It's like, you charged me twice for the same room. The only reason I picked this hotel, was because with the Pride festivities going on, everything was booked, or the prices were higher than usual. This hotel was advertised as $101/night on Expedia. My brother paid for me and his daughter (my niece) to stay there for 2-nights. The price was $268 total. That should've covered everything that comes with the hotel!

Otherwise everything else was fine. The hotel is expensive don�t be broke when you go or stingy.

The concierge was also very friendly and helpful. The kids loved the pool, they have a verity of floaties you can rent and exchange as much as you want within the time allotted. They also have a bus that runs all day to and from all Disney parks. The kids didn�t even care to leave the hotel, they loved it.

However, we went to get breakfast, they said only adults get free breakfast and I have to pay for all kids. I told them that their websites did not mention kids and adults, and they just mention 25 dollars per room for free breakfast. I paid a total of 50 $ extra to get breakfast included per night. Why should I pay 50 dollars plus another 50 dollars for the kids, a total of 100$ a day to get breakfast? It was a ripoff. I called Expedia and they agree that the hotel is wrong. Expedia gave me my money back and rewarded me 100 USD.

Tick Tock manager (?) could be a little friendlier at initial contact but seems to just have that gruff personality and was very accommodating. Room and building was very clean but still had very old bathroom fixtures ( stleast my room). Historically interesting to see but bit more difficult to use. No bathroom counter space. No coffee machine in room or refrigerator. The overall experience was good. So much more interesting than a usual chain hotel. I would definitely consider returning unless I find another affordable historic hotel to experience. One thought for improvement would be to spruce up Tick Tock�s decor A little. Wouldn�t change it�s overall character but better furniture, a maybe mix in some of the historical character of The New Yorker without losing the open and easy atmosphere.

The cleaning staff needs to step up their game. Several times the daily garbage wasn�t emptied. Had to use another bag for trash. 
 2). The ice machine on my floor was down, not a big deal as I only had to go one floor up or down to get ice but there was no sign of any attempt on it being fixed, looked at, or notification that it�s bing worked on the week I was there and the exhaust fan in the bathroom wasn�t working and again no sign of it being looked at or notification for the whole week. Lastly the parking area needs to be addressed. I�m paying to park there and when I return at night there are no spaces available. How does one not have enough parking spaces per the number of rooms. Staff did offer valet parking to accommodate me but it still should be addressed. 
 But overall had a fantastic stay there.

 I made the mistake of allowing them to valet my mustang only to watch from my room on the 18th floor as two teenagers drove it around the parking lot at over 30 mph and then proceeded to sit in my car for over 5 min.
 When I confronted them they claimed they couldn�t speak English and didn�t know who it was that parked my car.
 Don�t trust them!!!!
 Also check in was way too long! Took over 20 min to check in and then they make you go to a separate counter where they high pressure you into taking a tour of their vacation club. It took us another 10 min to get away from them and get the key to our room finally. If you refuse to talk to them they will not give you a code for parking. 
 No parking in self parking at all! Very crowded.
 The pools were dirty and smelled of high chlorine levels. My daughters eyes were swollen and red after only 10 min of swimming.
 No water pressure in the bathroom. Tub leaked all night made multiple calls to have someone fix it so it would run all night nobody ever came.
 Housekeeping was knocking on the door at 9 am wanting to know when we were checking out even though we had the do not disturb on the door.
 Really I�ve stayed at most of the resorts in the area and this was the worst.
 I�m also sending a formal complaint to Disney because they are an official Disney hotel and shouldn�t be.

Im Bad ist alles total abgeranzt und versifft was nicht an der Reinigungsleistung der Zimmerm�dchen liegt sondern weil bis auf ein bi�chen Farbe , Jahrzehntelang nichts gemacht worden ist. Der Teppichboden im Zimmer ist auch total runtergerockt und noch der gleiche wie schon 2009.In Deutschland findet man so eine Einrichtung bei irgendeiner Oma auf dem Land die in ihrem Haus ein Pension betreibt aber nicht in einem Gro�stadthotel das 250� die Nacht kostet.
 Die gr��te Frechheit ist die Geb�hr von 35$ pro Nacht f�r die Benutzung von Businesscenter , Gym und Internet....Ich habe nicht von den drei Sachen in Anspruch genommen und ich habe dies auch beim Check-In gesagt. Man hat diese Geb�hr zu zahlen ob man die Sachen nutzt oder nicht.... Den Hals nicht vollbekommen k�nnen nehme ich das.
 Das Hauseigene Tik Tok Diner ist auch so eine Sache...Bei unserem letzten Besuch waren wir fast t�glich zum Essen dort weil es zum einen Super Lecker war, aber es wurde das Konzept umgestellt .Die Burger (ab16$ und kleiner als Cheeseburger bei McDonalds) schmecken grottenschlecht und auch alle andere Gerichte sind nicht mehr gut sondern nur noch Teuer....Spaghetti Bolognese f�r 19$....Mir ist bewu�t das New York /Manhattan sehr sehr teuer ist!

There was trash on a chair in our room and my husband found a cockroach. I think it was alive. In the lobby, the floors and chairs were visibly dirty. Hotel room doors were visibly dirty. There were stains all over the carpet in the rooms and in the hall leading down to our rooms. Birds were nesting in air conditioner vents on the third floor. This hotel was disgusting. I will never stay here again.

"Very good location close to Penn Station in midtown. View from a metro view room was worthwhile - we could see the Hudson. Staff were all friendly. Handy USB chargers in the room made life easy for phones and ipads. Decor is art deco based - not my taste but sort of works. Room had hairdryer and iron so useful for tidying up for evening forays into the city. Overall good value and would certainly be on my list in future.

"Location of this hotel is very good. Walking to Disney Springs in 5 minutes. I also liked the shuttles service to Disney Parks. Did not like that the Bar next to pool did not have kids menu, mostly everyone goes there with kids because it�s all about Disney and kids and they have no kids menu, big minus.

"The first thing we did not like was that the man who checked us in acted like we were his least favorite people even though we had never met and I greeted him normally. Secondly, he told us we had a second floor room and we had 5 pieces of luggage - one of them extremely heavy. I asked where the elevator was and he said there wasn't one. He showed us a map of where the room was and wished us a good night. We would never have found the room and we would have had to hump all those bags upstairs by ourselves if the van driver had not come and helped us. Big thumbs down to the desk clerk - he might have offered us a ground floor room. Secondly, there was no way to turn on a light in the room when we got there. No wall switches or card swipes - had to walk into a dark room and feel around for a light switch for the desk lamp. The shower head delivered a very weak stream of water and the shower curtain was broken on the shower head side of the tub, so water all over the floor. The only reason I gave the staff a good rating is because of the one guy, the van driver who was wearing a cap with the word ""Security"" on it, was nice and kind and helpful. We booked via Expedia and thought we were getting a room with a complimentary breakfast, as it advertises on-line. But if you book a discounted room, you don't get a free breakfast. No where did it state that during the booking process.

"It's a fairly underwhelming entrance with, Saturday night, a noisy bar semi integral. The aircon wasn't working and the option provided was to find another hotel. They put a fan in the room and offered 1 free beer (in the noisy bar). The room was a decent size but yes, got pretty warm. The bathroom shower design means you get the rest of the bathroom pretty wet and the extractor fan doesn't seem to work.

"When you walk to the elevators you feel like your walking straight into american horror story..the elevators are old open slow shake and your never sure your going to make it to your floor. The dingy brown carpet makes the hallways dark and scary. The rooms are awful so small you cant move. You take 2 steps in the front door and run into a bed. Cant get around the bed because of the desk at the end so have to throw luggage over the bed to get it to the other side of the room. You run into the desk everytime you need to get to the bathroom. Not sure how multiple adults are supposed to stay in such a small room. I had one adult and one teenager and we had no room. The pictures on the website of the rooms are NOT accurate at all false advertising! Not to mention the paper thin doors and walls. Every day you could hear staff loadly on thier walkie talkies. No insullation for the windows could hear streer traffic,sirens and construstion all day and night! The bathroom was horrible again so small you could barely turn around. Tub was stained, paint peeling everywhere, faucet piece falling off. No ventalation whatso ever in the bathroom so when you take a shower the condensation builds on the ceiling so when you get out your being constantly pelted with water. This place is nowhere near a 4 star hotel. Its 2 min! BUYER BEWARE!! If your ok staying at Motel 6's then you will be fine here. But if you expect more or even whats advertised on the website you will be disappointed.

"The check in process was incredibly fast and without hassle. We were scheduled to check in at 4pm, but our flight landed at 745am in Orlando. I spoke with the front desk about possibly holding my party's luggage, and they informed me my room was actually already ready to go. 
 
 The property itself is nice, and I enjoyed the pool area. The rooms were clean, but small. For the price I paid, this was more than sufficient enough for my stay. It's not the fanciest hotel, but I do think if you can get this room cheap enough, for being a Disney Hotel, it is worth the price and would stay back again.

HMMM Also when I asked about a car service the man at the desk told me to call down from the room in the morning to arrange it.During this conversation another person came to the desk and he did not look happy with his colleague AT ALL. He told me as long as I could tell him an exact time he could arrange it now,.He did do that.It just seemed like the one guy didn't want to do anything to help at all. Happy to do nothing and get his check.
 I will say the young ladies at the desk in the morning were very pleasant and helpful.
 Breakfast was above average and the waitstaff were very good as well.

"The room was very clean which is most important. I think we stayed in an older section of the hotel though. The room was surprisingly sparse, no pictures on the walls. No microwave, which was very disappointing. The beds were very hard and made sleeping uncomfortable. The closet was extremely awkward to hang clothes in. The elevators were very small and seemed to have no air ventilation. The pool was very nice but the pool bar/restaurant was closed for some reason and there were many of us hoping to get some drinks and food. I also think its insane to charge people $20 + tax per night for parking on top of paying for the room and the added ""resort fees"". But to be positive, good location, very nice pool and a clean room.

"The location was okay but we had a huge issue with our AC and we checked in at 6:15 at night and immediately called to let them know our AC wasn't working, the room was 90 degrees. They sent a service man to assist and he said he reset it and it would take an hour but it would start cooling off. It did cool off for about 15mins and then it stopped working again. We kept calling to the front desk and they said someone would come up but then we would receive a call 15 mins later to make sure we were happy with the new AC. I would tell them no one has been back to the room and it still wasn't working so they would apologize and say we will add a ticket in. This happened 3 times before a different engineer came. He was absolutely amazing and he said he had already replaced 4 AC's that day. He worked on it for quite a while and then called the front desk to let them know they really needed to find us another room because this unit didn't work and he had already replaced 4 AC's today and he didn't have anymore left. They said they were full so he needed to try and figure something out. The poor guy literally went to the engineering shop and pieced together 4 different units to try in the room. After every one he would call the desk and say it was sweltering in our room and they needed to find us another room. However they kept claiming there was no other room. Magically after the 4th at 12:30pm a different room became available. 6 hours of sitting in a room that was 90 degrees.

"Super friendly staffs! And they are very knowledgeable about all transportations you can take to get about. Lovely pools from 7am to 11pm. Gym 24/7. Transparent about fees. 
 Because I had to leave very early in the morning, so check-out speed meant a lot -- their check-out is soooo fast and actually all I need to do was to leave the keys at room!
 Also the location is perfect - easy access to all attractions, and to very good food.
 I just love the room's A/C. A little bit old-fashioned, but easy to control. It feels cleaner than center-controlled A/C as well. 
 Only one thing not so great: wifi is kind of slow and unstable. But not a big deal...not everyone takes work to his/her vacation...I'm just an outlier.
 Moreover, they offered comeback discount! Valid for 6 months. Started to look forward to my next break....

Personeel is vriendelijk en servicegericht. Je moet inderdaad ter plekke nog resorttoeslag betalen van 37 dollar per nacht, maar dit wordt door Expedia wel heel netjes van tevoren aangegeven dus het was geen verrassing. Het zou handiger zijn als ze dit bedrag gewoon meenemen in het totaalbedrag dan zou je er niemand over horen. Enige minpunt vind ik dat je nog 5 dollar per bagagestuk moet betalen als je je bagage na uitchecken een paar uur wil laten staan. Zou wel netjes geweest zijn als dit dan ook onder de resorttoeslag zou vallen.

"If they weren't touching and moving all of my and girlfriend's stuff, they didn't make the bed or anything like that at all, location is not that convient, when you book online it tells you only 180$ for security deposit but when you get there you get told it's 280$ bc apparently it's 70$ a night for deposit, then when you get to the room there's a paper that says 40$ a night so which should be 160$. So I highly recommend staying anywhere but here

"The property is fine but needs a bit of renovation. The pillows were too big and the shower head was too low. None of those are major issues.
 
 The main issue was check-in. We traveled with 3 other couples and all of them got their rooms around 3pm. We went to check in before them all and were told our room wasn�t ready by two different front desk clerks. So we had to get back in line and wait for a different front desk clerk who miraculously had our room ready.
 
 I understand check in is at 4 but find it annoying that people who booked and checked in after us were given their rooms before us.

"Beautiful hotel in a prime location with excellent friendly and helpful staff.
 The hotel is much better than what it looks like on the pictures, it has a stunning setting with a lagoon that runs around the hotel, 2 pools and out door jacuzzi. The rooms have been modified and are excellent for what you need whilst staying in Orlando.
 The staff are amazing Anyka on reception especially who assisted no end and made it possible to upgrade to a premium room due to being there celebrating my birthday and being a member of the armed forces as it happened to be memorial weekend at the time, and this just enhanced the experience from start to finish. Sarah who works in both bars again is excellent, friendly and taking the time to speak to customers and ensuring they are looked after at all times whether it be in the hotel bar or the restaurant bar, a friendly face goes no end when people go out of their way to look after guests.
 The room service was excellent and done to a high standard every day and were always polite and helpful if needed for fresh towels, water etc.
 I�ve seen some negative reviews for this hotel which I think are unjust, for the price of the rooms in the location that it is, is excellent value for money, so much so I decided to stay for an extra two days at the end of my trip.
 Top class hotel with top class service.

Lobby staff (other than checkin/registration staff) not always friendly, realize they have to deal with tons of different tourists and guests which impacts always being positive. BUT...
 The Tick Tock restaurant was great. Very dissapointed at the most historical part of the hotel, the basement display of pictures and tesla. looks like a summer student put it together. The NYH is an icon and should also have a spot to sell hotel memorabilia. Wish I could have left with vintage posters, coasters,. Something. Overall a very positive experience.

Staff were all very friendly and amenities like in room services, pools, park shuttle and car parking were great. I struggled to find out if there was a shuttle prior to booking here. There is one for each Disney park and Disney springs which leaves in the morning and afternoon and also collects you from afternoon onwards- it was really easy to use. On our stay our sink in our bathroom got blocked but it was fixed ASAP. On one occasion our room wasn�t serviced but once we spoke to the desk they apologised and ensured it was done the next day. All in all would definitely recommend.

We could walk to the convention center and Disneyland easily. They have many options of restaurants nearby and it is a few steps from Anaheim Garden Walk. The front desk people were very accommodating specially Micky. The subterranean garage offered extra security to our car (which we didn�t need to use at all) with gates that operate only with your room key. We wish we could stay longer.

"I think calling it a resort is misleading. I associate resorts with lots of amenities, mostly golf, somewhat secluded. This is definitely near things--approximately two miles from Universal Studios amusement park, within walking distance of Icon Park. There was a pool. But think of it as a little more than an upmarket motel, and instead of the front door leading outside, it had a corridor and room service. Every room had a small balcony. Some rooms are definitely louder than others (if you didn't get a poolside room, you have the noise of Icon Park, the noise of the parking lot, or the noise of Universal Boulevard to look forward to. None of the buildings are particularly well marked-- if you tell me I'm in building 9, the building number itself is easily obscured, and the signs in the hallway might suggest that a room number beginning with 10 is in that building (it's not). No elevators, odd numbered rooms are on the top floor of a two story building, so pack lightly or ask for help getting your stuff to your room. Good wi-fi, ok television channel selections, and close to highway on/off ramps to get places. Resort fee included shuttle to Universal Studios-- but only twice in the mornings, and maybe 3 times approximately 8 hours later (the 2 mile walk back has sidewalks the entire way).

"Urspr�nglich gutes Angebot, sp�ter Ern�chterung
 
 Hotel in toller Lage. In die Jahre gekommen. Kein wirklich guter Service. 
 Schockiert waren wir, dass bei Abreise nich einmal fast 32$ PRO NACHT sogenannte �Facility Fee� angefallen sind. Das stand bei der Buchung im Kleingedruckten. Damit war das Hotel auch nicht wirklich g�nstig. Rechnet man das ein, h�tte es in der Umgebung g�nstigere Alternativen gegeben, ohne Zusatzgeb�hr. Wir w�rden das Hotel nicht weiter empfehlen.
 
 Die Lage ist wirklich gut. Direkt an der Penn Station. In der Umgebung gibt es sch�ne Restaurants zu angemessenen Preisen, z. B. das Chef Yu. Auch findet man sch�ne Bars teilweise mit Livemusik. 
 Die Subway Linien ACE sind direkt vor der T�r. Die 123 Linien einen Block entfernt. Man kommt schnell �berall hin.
 
 Die Zimmer sind stark abgewohnt. Es ist grunds�tzlich alles akzeptabel, aber nichts ist umfassend erneuert. Bei uns war die Toilette verstopft. Die Reparatur, war am Abend nicht erledigt, obwohl am Morgen gemeldet. H�tte der Zimmerservice auch merken m�ssen. Generell lief das Wasser extrem schlecht ab, eigentlich nicht akzeptabel. 
 Wir waren im 24. Stock. Die Assicht zur Stra�e war gut. Allerdings waren die Fenster derma�en dreckig, dass der Ausblick nur getr�bt m�glich war. Die Gardinen waren wohl ewig nicht gereinigt. 
 Die Aussicht war ok. Die Betten waren gut, die Handt�cher etc. waren sauber und reichlich. Die Dusche war gut, warmes Wasser und guter Wasserdruck.

"I travel a lot on business and have a fairly high tolerance... but this was a big disappointment. While the staff and service was great... my room had seen better days, shower didn't work so had to wait for maintenance to fix then only to dry off with towels that were completely threadbare and felt like cardboard. Also THE noisiest part of NYC I've ever stayed in. Right next to police station. Food in restaurant was also terrible. No beuno.

"it was my third time staying within two months only thing I went back was it was 20 dollars cheapers than Marriot hotel across the street. Of course, receptionists bothered to inform any information about breakfast,wifi, checking outtime. I had to call the front desk to find out evertthing. other two times I complained because of stinky smell of the rooms but this time, there were bed bugs and me and my friend got bitten several areas within just one night there. I counted, more than 10 bites. And my friend also had same marks as I did. I didnt bother to inform this complain becuase I know the fact that this hotel wont be changed and I rather pay extra money and go to Marriot hotel across the street where they have comfortable beds, nice smell, clean rooms which what a decent hotel suppose to have and this hotel doesnt. Thanks for the experience and I wont never go bacm and I will tell all my friends not to visit this hotel ever.

There was no microwave in the room and since there were no vending machines we had to eat cold food. They seriously need to do some major upgrades to this property.

"It was advertised as a Disney certified resort, with all the perks. It felt like A little brother to a Disney Resort. The shuttle service wasn�t easy or convenient. Coach buses, not Disney busses. Dropped off far from park entrances (TTC at the Magic Kingdom, so you have to take the boat or monorail). Pick up not clearly marked and was confusing. 
 
 Parking was also a joke. Could only park on one side of the building, so I had to make the long walk with all my luggage in the pouring rain while holding a sleeping kid. Why not let parking in both sides?

Valet parking, huge lobby with bar and shops, all elegant just what I wanted UNTIL you get your room you go to park and find it you in a shabby building like most inexpensive motels. Completely motel style and completely excluded from the elegance of the main building and hotel. Definitely look through all the pictures before booking, personally I don�t even think showed the motel style building or rooms. When I drove up they were even well hidden enough by walls and being lower then the main building it was a total shock when I found my room. NOT at all where I thought I was staying. Paper thin walls, stained ceiling, wet carpet. Don�t be fouled by the pictures.

Also there was no water pressure in the or hot water at 9:00am on my first morning there which made it further impossible to take a shower.

The fact that the parking for the guests was on the opposite side of the building because valet took the other side made it very disappointing. When I went to park my car the pass code wasn�t given so I had to drive upstairs & was almost involved in an accident due to the driver next to my vehicle almost hit my car due to the tight fit. Upon entering my hotel room the smoke alarm sensor was going off & I had to go downstairs & alert the staff this annoying situation I could go on & on but luckily my stay was only for two days & not longer. I will definitely not stay at this hotel again.

"Had a very pleasant stay. Have stayed before and like this hotel due to location, good security, and the restaurant attached. �Tick Tock� is 24/7 and does some really nice meals for those times when you just want to eat local for breakfast or any other time. I did not use bar or sports facilities. Internet was good and international phone calls are free as part of the additional resort charges. Staff were helpful and there is a good left luggage service for the day you leave. 5 dollars per bag and then you free to do a further explore. We left bags and then went to Central Park for a few hours until departure time. We had a room that was billed as 2 double beds. There was 3 of us and taking this room option over 2 separate rooms saved us about �1000 which is a big chunk of spending money. Only real downside was the mattress sagged towards the middle. I imagine the rooms are used as upgraded twins the majority of the time. This meant you gravitated to the centre. As a single it was fine, but struggled as a double. Shower, coffee making facilities, fridge and so on in the room were fine. Cleanliness very good. So apart from a slightly saggy mattress this hotel ticked all the boxes for us. Would recommend for any family group, or lads away weekend. Great Irish bar across street and round corner �Jack Doyles�, 35th....and Pig & Whistle on next street 36th. But there is no shortage of bars and restaurants anywhere in NY. The New Yorker on 8th Avenue however is an iconic hotel.

"The New Yorker Hotel is located in an ideal area in midtown Manhattan. The quality of the rooms very much depends on what floor you're on. My first room was not impressive at all with paint peeling of the walls in the bathroom. I requested a room change, which was granted, and the new room was a bit more modern, but had no storage for clothing. The worst part of my stay at The New Yorker Hotel was the non negotiable fee they charge you for wifi and phone. They charge, after taxes, almost $40 a night in addition to your regular bill. Other similar hotels charge similar fees, but give you food and entertainment vouchers that can help balance things out. There are definitely better options in the city, but in a pinch, this hotel does offer comfortable beds in a convenient location.

First, the guy at reception tries to upsell us on an upgraded room that has no balcony but does have a set of bunk beds in the room - why on earth would a couple want to pay more to have less ie no balcony? and why would we want to pay more to have a set of bunk beds that we are not going to use?! When we got to our room and realised there was no bathtub (even though we had verified it with the receptionist) we called the guest services line and an unenthusiastic voice told us to come back down and tell reception. No 'sorry about that' or 'we will be glad to help you!'. The second receptionist guy basically said the expedia descriptor was false - they don't have any rooms like that - and blamed his reservation colleagues saying there was nothing he could do. And on it went... 
 This hotel nickel and dimes you for everything - even when things don't cost you money they cost you in stress and make it difficult for you to just enjoy and relax. For example, nice pool area but why do you treat hotel guests as towel-stealing criminals before they have even entered the pool?! You have to sign out your towels - number of towels, room and name - and god forbid you don't return one, they will hunt you down!! 
 Staff are not happy, tables left dirty too long and service at bars/pool is slooooooow.

"The hotel was well situated but there were a lot of hidden extra's - even after a 3 rooms and a 6 night stay in each they wanted USD30 to store bags for 60mins. Wifi was a joke although you are paying USD35 per day for the extras (no choice have to pay it)which included wi-fi and some free calls.
 Some if the rooms although the same price were much bigger than others - overall not bad but would not stay there again.

"I hated that check in was so late. You can't check in until 4pm which is late. And if you get to the hotel early you can have them hold your luggage for you until your room is ready but you have to pay $5.00 per bag for them to hold onto it. After spending almost $600.00 just for 1 night you would think they could hold your luggage for free. Was not impressed with this hotel at all. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Will not stay here again. Beds are also very uncomfortable.

"Hotellet har perfekt beliggenhet! Rett ved Pen Station Subway, som tar deg omtrent hvor du vil. Togstasjonen til Newark Airpost er ogs� n�rmeste nabo. Kort gangavstand til severdigheter som Empire State Building, Time Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center, 5Av., Macy's mm. Hotellrommet var veldig lite. Men s�nn jeg har forst�tt det, s� er dette normalen i hele byen. Drar man p� ferie for � oppdage byen, er ikke dette noe problem. Hyggelig betjening, rene rom hver dag. Standarden p� rommet er noe eldre, men etter min mening var det noe av sjarmen. Litt vanskelig � finne riktig temperatur p� dusjen dog. �nsker man en hotellferie, der mye av tiden skal brukes p� hotellet, ville jeg g�tt for noe annet.
 
 B�de frokostdiner (Tick Tock) og restaurant p� hotellet. Restauranten var god, men noget dyr, Dineren er ogs� kurrant, selv om jeg anbefaler � g� rundt hj�rnet til Stardust Diner, som var bedre og billigere.
 
 Alt i alt en god hotellopplevelse, som kan anbefales. (tips: sp�r om utsikt mot Empire State Building, det var et nydelig skue � v�kne opp til hver morgen :)

"I stayed 4 nights in Orlando and of course wanted to book with Wyndham like always. But I was very disappointed with my stay this time sadly. The tv in our room was buzzing, the cable was out for a whole day, the sink in the bathroom was stuck on off for awhile. It was hard to turn on. The grout in the shower was gross and it never stayed cool in our room. I�m coming back in September for my bday like I always do and would like to still go there

"Our stay was for four days and the reception was welcoming and helpful.The room itself on the 24th floor was in the same style as the reception, art deco and was clean with a comfortable bed. The bathroom was adequate but slightly dated with a bath and shower but no plug. The shower was powerful but the water at peak times was not hot. The TV was excellent and an iron and hairdryer were in the room. No tea making facilities though although this could be rented.The attached restaurant is open 24 hrs which is useful and they provided (if slightly costly) snacks and beverages. The room was on the 24th floor and had a view of the empire state building but you do have to keep the curtains closed as light pollution upsets restful sleep. The location is excellent to get to the central attractions and shopping. Food locally is plentiful as are bars. Overall I think this hotel is great value for the money but would have liked tea/coffee making facilities included but that said a 4 out of 5 from me.

The other hotel was at least a 9 compared to it. Plus had to pay to park. I�ll never go back to that hotel. Although it was close to Disney Springs, I�d still rather drive a extra 10 minutes and stay somewhere else.

However, we had to change rooms for a night due to the A/C not working, and upon our return to our favorite room, the heating system broke down. We also experienced a strong cigarette smell through the vent twice...not the hotel's fault of course, but unpleasant. Staff is very attentive, courteous and kind. Not a very family-friendly hotel; but truly ideal for the business traveler or for families with older kids. We really enjoyed our stay in spite of a couple of issues!

I always bring Clorox wipes and wipe down all my surfaces myself. What I really didn�t like was there were 2 trays of old room service in the hall for our entire 3 day stay. There was one in front of the next door and the across the hall. I don�t get why house keeping didn�t pick up. I was worried it may attract pests. It�s good place to stay if you�re looking for a low rate and won�t be in your room except to sleep.

"Negative - I choice this hotel and paid more to stay here because it had the valet parking that several others in the area did not have. There was another hotel with limited hotel parking that was less and we chose not to stay there because we know how the parking in NY can be. Yet, on the 2nd night we arrived back at 4AM from being out with my family and was told that the valet was full. This was absolutely ridiculous. My husband then had to park over two blocks away on the street. If we wanted street parking there were many other hotels that were less expensive where we could have stayed. What also makes matters worst is I called this hotel before book to confirm the valet parking and they did not mention that it's limited valet. 
 
 Positive - The front desk staff was pleasant, check was smooth, the room was pretty clean. I think they cold have paid a little more attention cleaning the bathroom but not significant enough to call housekeeping to come back. The area felt save and very close to the mall and restaurants within walking distant; the airports are about 17 mins from LGA and 22 mins to JFK. 
 
 The room was very small is especially to hold 2 queen sized beds and 4 adults. We stayed two night for my Dad's funeral so it wasn't too bad. The price was reasonable for the area but given that I was expecting valet and ended up parking on the street it was not work the $145/night stay.

 We arrived at the hotel and were ignored by the front desk. When checking in, we asked for a king bed due to a long flight prior to our arrival and the front desk associate said no with an attitude. Instead, we were put in a bedroom the size of a linen closet. You could barely open the door to get into the room. Once inside, there was no room to walk or relax. The bathroom door opened right into the toilet leaving no space. The wall on the left side of the bed was also jutted out causing injury.

"Jaded and faded. Great location but that's it. The New Yorker was probably the height of fashion in the 1930s but that's probably when it was last renovated. If you enjoy a time travel experience where you are woken by the rattling pipes at 5am every time someone in a room around you uses the bathroom then you will love it. Probably best for those deep sleepers only. Definitely not New York's finest.

"Two night stay in the San Jose airport area. The hotel is next to a big empty lot full of homeless people camping there. It is in the industrial part of the airport, there's really nothing to walk around other than the restaurant at the hotel. We were given the room by the pool, it's really noisy. The air-conditioner does not work, we have to call front desk to have the technician fixed it. The biggest issue is room service. We kept calling for extra towels, there was four of us and they would only give us two sets. Each time they would come over and bring two large towels only, no Small, no medium. The second day was the same thing, she literally just brought over to lifestyle, as I was explaining to her we need small and medium, she just turned around and left. She never came back

Overall i was dissapointed for a Wyndam hotel.

 Fantastisk placering og var min 2. gang p� dette hotel
 MINUS: de forlanger 31$ pr. overnatning for brug af wifi, fitness - hvilket jeg finder fuldst�ndig vanvittigt. Vi brugte ikke fitness og er kun on-line kort om morgenen og m�ske lidt mere om aftenen.
 Vi kunne ikke v�lge det fra.
 Derudover koblede de os af mulighed for wifi om morgenen p� dagen for afrejse 3 timer inden vi tjekkede ud!!! Simpelthen for ringe service.
 Desuden tager de 5$ pr. kuffert/taske/pose som man �nsker opbevaret efter udtjekning og inden man skal rejse hjem. 
 En stor pengemaskine jeg finder helt urimelig.

"I have taken pictures of dirty net curtains dirty skirting boards and poor condition of decor in bedroom and bathroom, the internet which has a cost of $252.56 was extremely slow and constantly lagging. I have let the New Yorker know and I have not yet received a reply as yet however upon check out I was given a very small refund of x2 $29 plus x2 $2.57 sales tax. I would therefore like to be reimbursed the rest of the money for a very poor service. The total amount is $189.42

"We arrived at the front desk after a long trip into NYC. We were greeted with a smile and a very pleasant conversation from the clerk. We were quickly checked in and directed to our room. The room as small but comfortably laid out. We were on the 21 floor with a beautiful view of the city and its lights. The hotel is old so the corridors are winding and a bit challenging when you are tired. They are clearly marked but returning to the elevator was always an adventure. We had breakfast in the attached diner the next morning and were captivated by the decor, clocks and clever saying keep us smiling while waiting for our breakfast. I highly recommend the Lemon ricotta quinoa pancakes with blueberry sauce. TickTock Diner is a wonderful addition to the hotel.

"El hotel es bueno y est�,muy bien ubicado. Las habitaciones son de tama�o aceptable y el ba�o esta muy bien. Lo cuestionable es la pol�tica de check in, en cuanto al horario. La hora,de admisi�n es 4:00PM, pero te ofrecen admitirte antes si pagas U$ 50 extra. Encuentro esto poco �tico, toda vez que si tienen la habitaci�n lista y t� est�s all�, es claro que te la niegan para sacarte dinero. Entiendo que son reglas del hotel, pero debo decir que no me gustan.

"Let me start by saying that the hotel it self was very nice. Check in was very easy the lobby was beautiful. When I got inside my room I noticed a weird smell. But we were so tired we slept right through it. The next morning we were picking up our stuff to leave and I went to go through a piece of paper in the garbage can that was under the table. I noticed the paper was floating, so I pulled the garbage can out and it was halfway full of some liquid which I soon found out was urine. It smelled horrible and when I went to pour it out in the toilet it was yellow. I can�t believe that whoever cleaned the room didn�t check the garbage can. I�m not big on complaining or leaving reviews but this was just unacceptable. When I checked out later that morning I told the lady at the front desk what happened and she wrote it down on a piece of paper. And continued my check out. I don�t think that was right at all, I�m highly disgusted at what happened

"Our family takes about a dozen staycations a year staying at various resorts. We felt that this resort didn�t have that many amentities for how big of a resort it was. We received a voicemail that we could go on a timeshare sales pitch and receive a two night stay for $99. Which didn�t feel great since we paid over $250 for a one night stay. Overall our experience was ok, we wouldn�t stay at this resort in the future.

After giving her two days to investigate my complaint I called her again and she stated she had no time for my complaint and would offer me a 10% discount on a future reservation. One problem is there will never be a future reservation at this hotel for me. HOW INSULTING!

Then I didn't have enough time to go to my car and get everything to my room and so they let me use one of there luggage locks to keep my stuff safe and they watched my bag and delivered it to my room. The room was really clean, wifi was simple and easy to use. Pool was empty at 2am so it was great. The fitness center was updated with new equipment. I only was there from 8:30pm Wednesday until 9:45am Thursday. I wish I had more time there to stay but tight budget. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. Trying to book it again actually.

"Would not stay here again! Been to the Disney Springs area many times, but my favourite hotels were fully booked. Decided to give Wyndham a go for one night before flying home to the U.K... I was not put in the main tower of the hotel, and if I had been I�m sure my experience would have been different. I was given a room in one of the courtyard type buildings connected to the hotel, which look more like a motel. I was on the ground floor, facing the car park. It was very noisy well into the night, with cars pulling up outside my room until around 1.30am and some honking their horns. After finally getting to sleep, I was then awoken early by all the delivery trucks pulling into the car park. To top it off, room service were knocking on my door before 9am to see if I�d checked out so they could turn my room over. Certainly not a relaxing experience before a long haul flight home. Would not reccoment to anyone visiting the Disney area, there are much nicer hotels with more modern facilities - this hotel felt very run down in the courtyard area, can�t speak for tower rooms. The pool area also isn�t the best. Staff were all nice, shame about the hotel itself.

"This hotel was actually very nice and we enjoyed staying here very much. Pretty much the only two issues we had were the jacuzzi/pool area was absolutely disgusting. My wife and I were going in and the entire area was covered in dirty towels and empty glasses and trash everywhere. Not to mention that both the jacuzzi and pool were yellow. The other issue was the parking bill they charged us for. It was an obvious hidden fee that we occurred on our last day there. It�s fine to charge but let us know ahead of time.

"Beautiful hotel with lots to do. Staff was super friendly and the rooms were nice and the beds were super comfy. The only thing I didn�t like was the breakfast buffet. It was a bit pricey for mediocre quality. The muffins, bagels, and French toast were very stale. They did have food that they made fresh for you like,omelets, pancakes, and waffles and those were good but the price point was a bit high. Other than that it was great I would definitely come back.

The toilet had splatter on it, the shower head was covered in slime, there were drips of coffee on the counter, hairs in the sink, the floor had not been swept, mopped or vaccumed. The refridgerator was dirty and the mirrors had what looked like pimple juice splatter on them. We were disgusted! To top it off they offered to not charge me for the room but at check out i had to battle with the services director. I recieved a one night refund after being told my 2 night stay would be comped. Very dissapointed! Oh, the food was terrible and extremely over priced!

"We loved the location of the property, so close to Disney springs! Fun evening entertainment at Disney springs. We were on a ground level floor (1040), super convenient to get to the lobby, Disney springs, smoking area was directly across from us which was convenient. The pool was so close too. Loved the pool! Perfect for our 5 year old. The room was an average size, liked that the bathroom had a sliding door so you could be quiet in the morning. Our room did have a small gap between the door and floor which I think let bugs in- or they were coming in the bathroom vents or drains. We didn�t notice them much in the bed area but the bathroom was terrible. It was disgusting actually. Beds were comfy and clean. The daily cleaning staff didn�t do great jobs, we felt like our beds got made and that was it. The hotel has a character breakfast a few days a week and that was great. Not busy at all, the restaurant staff were amazing. I would go back but inquire about the bugs (they were only small and didn�t bother us, the kind of flying insects that love showrrs and sinks).

Honestly not too different from the D value resorts. Loved the lobby and the staff at the hotel. Easy check in/check out! Valet parking was great ($20 per night) *which is about what the on site hotels charge now anyway... great coffee shop in lobby for grab n go, restaurant on site if needed, and Disney Springs a short walk away. Pool was gorgeous. Rooms.... definitely showing their age! I�m very particular about cleanliness and I must admit the rooms are outdated but clean! 2 Double beds in our room, room service menu (didn�t use though) and decent sized room overall. (Tad larger than D value resort rooms)
 Overall, I would absolutely stay again... and again, I�m fussy. If you are seeking luxury or modern style, upgrade. If you are a family on a budget but still want all the �resort fun and feels� Whyndham is a great option!

"We stayed here for 1 night before heading out of San Jose airport. The hotel offers a shuttle to and from the, 5 miles away, airport.
 Jordan helped us on our arrival and was fairly indifferent, bordering on rude. Upon our return to the San Jose Airport, we followed their instructions to call for a shuddle when we were ready - that was at 6:05pm. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we called the front desk who told us they�d call the driver to find out where he was. After another 10 minutes we called again and they said he was on his way. Long story short, he arrived at the airport at 7:02pm (in the hour we sat there waiting we saw all the other airport shuttles come by 3-4 times so I�d definitely recommend any other hotel). When we talked to the driver he told us he was on his lunch break. We talked to Jordan at the front desk about our frustration and he was short, rude, and seemed like he could really care less. When we asked why it took so long he said he didn�t know the driver was on his lunch break, I asked why he didn�t know and he said because he was also on break. I guess my frustration lies in the fact that every other business functions while employees are on breaks, but apparently this hotel shuts down while the employees take their breaks. The room was overpriced and for the price to leave your car overnight, you would hope they could get you a shuddle after a long day of travel in less than an hour. Definitely doesn�t deserve my money or yours.

"Stayed at this hotel for the location. Room was small but it's NYC so that was suspected. For the most part clean did see noticable mold in shower and visible dust/dirt in the vents. However had a nice time. Staff was friendly except for the Wyndham desk people who quickly reminded me of the people at all the tourist traps in the city trying to sucker you in for a deal that's not really a deal. Needed directions to the bathroom in the lobby after pre registration and the woman ignores my question while my son is getting ready to pee his pants and insteads tries to sell me tourist packages. Skip the free gift that is stated on tour room keep. It's not worth the hassle. After waiting and watching her struggle over her sales pitch, I got my NYer attitude on and walked away from her. Found the info desk and they were very helpful and got a key for the bathroom immediately. Felt safe and secure in the hotel at all times. They had an employee checking keys to make sure the right people are in the hotel. Strongly recommend the diner attached to the hotel. Quick food and friendly service. Perfect location for events at MSG. We were there for a Rangers game. Subway is right outside and just up a couple blocks is times square, around the corner is Macy's and a small jaunt is Rockefeller Center. Subway takes you right to World Trade Center and a 10 minute walk from there is Statue of Liberty. Good location to get around.

The bed was so incredibly comfortable and the pillows were amazingly soft! I wish I could have taken them home! The one thing this hotel could use is a free breakfast in the morning. This is one thing my family appreciates in a hotel. Overall great stay, amazing staff, room was beautiful!

The only thing that really annoyed me was the loud music that was playing down at the pool, especially at night.

The room view was not what I booked which was s garden view but a parking lot which added to the noice of car locking beeping noises till 1-2 in the morning .

I was headed to a Disney theme park and had to postpone my arrival time to the park to wait for an available room. When I insisted, I was finally given a room next to the maintenance storage closet. The room was extremely dated, smelled musty and had stains on the ceiling and bathroom tile. I asked the front desk for another room and was adamantly told that there were no other available rooms. When I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager, I was told that they were indisposed and not available to speak to me. During the night I heard a couple having sex and it was very awkward and inappropriate. 
  Additionally, I was charged $20.00 for parking which was not disclosed at the time I booked the room.

"I loved the place, very beautiful and the staff was super polite and nice. But the floors of the room was very dirty and since we were traveling with our puppy, we couldn't let them do a proper cleaning to the room but the floor when we first got to the hotel was really dirty. The 2nd thing we didnt like was that my booking said break fast included but if you are booking a room for 3 in which includeds a child, it does not make sence that the hotel gives you one free breakfast passed that covers the meal of the 2 adult but not childs, making you pay $9 plus tax for the childs break fast. We dislike this very much. The 3rd thing we did not like was that on check out day, one lady (staff) that was checking the rooms knocked on out room at 8:00 am to remind us that check out time was at 11:00 am of that same day. We think that knocked was un necessary and very inconsiderate from their part to wake up someone that early just for a reminder like if we didnt know or like if we were passed our check out time. Very rude. Besides, those 3 points, our stayed at the hotel was placent.

 Very noisy - could hear outside noise (like carts) and walls were not insulated properly for room-to-room chatter). Big issue regarding lack of a diet soft drink ( I can't have sugar based sodas ). There were non on a Friday night) Staff at desk suggested I could walk to 7-11 (about 2 blocks away) and get there. I suggested someone from the staff could go get some and they brushed me off. Just curious, I checked on Saturday night to see if they had stocked any (of course NO). Since they really don't care about guest needs - we checked out on Sunday - a day early and found another place. Standards not up to what I would expect from Wyndham. Will not stay there again when I am in the area.

The only real negative was that the hotel does not have a parking lot. you either pay $25 for valet parking or park on the street.

"Booked this last minute due to our original hotel being overbooked. Found out there was a horror convention happening, so parking was almost impossible and trying to relax by the pool areas was a little awkward when you have Freddy Krueger wandering around. Lastly the walls were paper thin. I thought the people next door were in our bathroom with us because we could hear them clear as day. On the other hand, we were in close proximity to Wawa, which was the first time we went to one - that was nice.

"We flew to Orlando from Kansas to experience our first night of vacation a BIG disappointment. I booked a king size room online ahead of time and when I arrived was told that the king size rooms were all out and I would have to take a room with 2 double beds. After a polite discussion with the staff I was told for the smaller bed they would give us free breakfast in the morning. It is 10pm so we take the room. Get to the room in Bldg. 12 that is on the ground floor with sliding door facing the parking lot by a Wawa convenience store with people driving by continuously and people standing outside window drinking and being loud. Went back to front desk & told them I needed another room where we would feel safer, (now more upset about not getting my king bed I booked). Told they have no rooms, requested to speak with a Manager about the problems of not getting the King I booked and feeling unsafe in the lower floor room with my wife. The Manager is able to find us a room in Bldg. 6 that is still not a King but has 2 double beds on 2nd floor. The only good thing is doorman got a golf cart and took our luggage & escorted us to the other building. Now we are going upstairs to our room and there is a strong odor of marijuana outside. I have had nicer rooms at Motel 6. This is not what I would expect or have received from other Wyndham Hotels. This place is a major disappointment to us. Did not sleep well in double bed because we have a king size at home & that is what I booked.

 Cons:Loud! From the people outside the rooms talking all night, the airplanes going overhead, and thin walls it was hard to get a good nights sleep. 
 
 Great budget friendly place to stay, I would just ask for a room not facing a street and on the second floor. You will still get some noise, but that should help.

"I guess you get what you pay for, located right next to a homeless camp, I didn�t realize this was a motel style place. It felt and looked like a cheap motel. Our initial room had a horrible smell like body odor. We did contact the front desk and they switched us rooms. Second room was better smell wise, and the bed was ok. Place just felt cheap and unclean though. Paint pealing on walls in bathroom, walls dirty and stained in places. Was loud, cars coming and going and TVs/neighbors could be easily heard through walls. Would not go back.

I also called and was told I could use a hotel discount card, which I pay for, being in the state�s tourism industry, and I spoke to several employees before arriving, when I arrived, was told I couldn�t use it and I had to do something when I booked, which is exactly why I called ahead. The property was nice but too big for me. The room was good. I did have a bug on the ceiling that was dead, I found out and was just stuck there. No one had bothered to clean it and get it down. There was also a hair in my shower, stuck to the wall, before I ever used it.

The heating a air conditioning was difficult to work and didn't have any instructions. The TV reception was not very good. The picture would pause frequently, and there were no instructions on channels and their corresponding numbers. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, so they send you across the parking lot to a bar and grill restaurant. The restaurant had reasonably good food, but the chairs were worn and needed replacing.

Comfortable bed, clean room and a nice pool which was heated, it was cool during the evenings and night but the water was amazing. Great property all around, could also use pools at the resort next door, teens loved the lazy river.

We waited outside for over an hour, for a false alarm. No one with the hotel staff ever informed us it was safe to go back in. I approached the the lobby hesitantly and was told it had been safe to return for over 30 minutes. Why didnt the hotel inform us that it was safe to return, instead of having us wait outside in our pajamas for so long? To make matters worse another evacuation alarm went off at 8AM Thursday morning. I called the hotel staff as soon as we made it safely outside and was informed we didnt need to evacuate. Again, why wasnt this announced over the intercom????? Horrible stay, terrible rest.

I had paid extra for what was called free breakfast. When we went to eat breakfast I asked the waiter about the free breakfast. He looked surprised and said he needed to check the list. He looked at the list and said my room was not on it. He finally relented when I showed him my email with free breakfast listed. He seated us the went to the kitchen. A few minutes later he brought each of us a few pieces of fruit and a danish. I asked if I could have oatmeal instead. He said this was all we got because it was a continental breakfast. I ate a few bites and left, telling myself I would never book another room with Wyndham Hotels.

"Our stay was very pleasant.. Nice, clean and great decorated rooms. And the bathrooms are fantastic lighting! Only two negatives i have are we called front desk to ask for a razor and they said housekeeping would deliver two for us.. A day later we still had no recieved them and didn�t for the duration of our stay. Also, on checkout day(which is 11 A.M) housekeeping knocked on our door at 8:50 wanting to clean our room, I barely made it to the door before she proceeded to enter her master room key to let herself in.. I opened the door to a confused look as to why we were still there and explained check out was not for 3 more hours. She seemed unbothered that she almost just walked into a room that had sleeping guests in it. She replied �oh ok� and proceeded on her way to the next room. No apology or excuse me. I felt that was very unprofessional for a resort of this type.

The area around Wyndham is great, there�s places to eat and lots of activities. The only thing i wish was better was the quality of the towels, they are too stiff and scratchy.

"This place has really gone down in quality. I was moved to 4 different rooms during my stay. Every room was dirty! One was used it had a wet towel, open soap and it smelled as if someone had used the restroom. I couldn�t believe it. To make things worse none of the room phones worked so I had to walk all the way to the front office. Not to mention this place is infested with roaches. Save your money do not book here. The only decent thing about my stay was the front desk woman was nice but I will definitely NEVER stay here again.

"Good location near Disney Springs. The room was more like a rundown roadside motel. Apparently there is a real hotel if you are in the main building but beware the garden is the motel like appendages to the real hotel.The shuttle to Disney took forever, and after wasting precious hours we ended up driving the next times. Housekeeping never visited our room. The front desk staff was friendly but apparently powerless to address any issues. I got a minor case of food poisoning at Joffrey's Cafe so my day at Magic Kingdom was rather uncomfortable. All in all I would recommend choosing a real Disney property or just save a lot of money and stay at a Motel 6, because that is about the quality of our room. Sadly we thought this was going to be a nice splurge vacation but it was very disappointing. Two thumbs down.

"It was a fun and quick stay this weekend. The hotel is clean and very easy to get to. A bonus is that it is walking distance to Disney Springs. The room was clean with the basic amenities you expect. A knock down here is that the shower was not good. The water temp changed every 15secs (yes I did time it after the first shower!). I�d suggest to everyone that they valet the car. Parking here is not fun or easy. Plus it cost the same amount ($20/day). Other than that, this was our 4th stay at this property and we will be coming back in August for Star Wars.

Well, the next day we head out early to the pool and the Jacuzzi was not working (no bubbles) and the other pool area closed off due to construction. So, we were NOT happy about this.

 Negatives: The bathtub condition was terrible. Peeling in several places. There�s no way anyone who wanted to take a bath would have wanted to do so in this tub. There was mold on the shower head and a very rusted vent cover. Very thin walls. 
 
 Also, there�s a $24 or more �resort fee�. No reason for it in the first place, but while their main pool was totally shut down and under repair it was ridiculous that they tried to charge for that. I mentioned this at check in and was told they could take half off the fee. When we received our check out receipt they had not given us the discount. They did refund the half off they had previously told us we could have. Had we not asked and double checked it would not have happened. When my husband called and asked if we could have a late check out they said, �No, we need you to be out at 11:00.� When my husband responded, �Is there anyway you can do a little later than that?� The response was simply, �Nope.� No �I�m sorry...� No explanation.

"We were disappointed in several aspects of our stay. First, we arrived several hours before check in and wanted to leave our luggage while we explored the city. We've done this several times at all other properties we've stayed in (In New York City, Chicago, etc). Here we were advised that we could leave our luggage in an open room off the lobby, but it would not be secure. They do not/can not tag and store luggage in a secure spot. While we were deciding what to do a hostess offered us coffee and directed us to the cream and sugar. We accepted the offer, poured a cup of coffee and shortly thereafter we were presented with a bill for nearly $8.00 for what we thought was complimentary coffee for guests. The room itself was clean and nice, no problems there. A sign on the door in the room says check out time was noon. As our flight didn't leave until 5pm we asked if there was any chance for late check out. We were advised that check out was 11am (although sign in room said noon???) and we would be charged $60 for late check out (again, they cannot securely store bags before or after check out). We decided to go for a bite to eat and when we returned at 10:20am our room keys had already been deactivated (which we didn't discover until we were at our room on the 14th floor). So in a nutshell not a terrible experience, just a lot of inconveniences. They really seem to want to soak every penny they can out of guests and have you there the bare minimum amount of time.

"Room was not ready until 4:30 ( check in is advertised at 4 pm) . I called approx. 10 times from 4 to 4pm to ask status of room and got a
 Busy signal all ten times . To make matters worse upon telling a front desk staff member of this when I finally arrived to check on room she was very dismissive - no apology .. not a care in the world Type attitude . Very dissapointing.. also not a big fan of the 20 dollar self parking fee which either I missed or was not advertised too loudly when you book. Very convenient to Disney springs so that�s a plus .

"I had booked a king room. I get there & they have some excuse why they didn�t have king room. They put me in a family room with smaller beds & bunkbeds. Just one night, cleaning up after a trade show. Amalya at the desk charged me $60 for checking out at 1 pm or 11 am. She doesn�t smile, treats you as if she�s doing me a favor. Plus she kept me waiting for 5 minutes doing who knows what on her computer. Hotel cannot come through on king bed but has to abide by random 2 hour late checkout. Makes me notice the problems with the room. It was actually fairly clean but shower tray built into wall to hold shampoo hits you when you stand in shower under rainfall. It�s uncomfortable. And they give you shampoo sufficient for one, crazy for a �family� room. Left a privacy sign on door during my extra 2 hours & sure enough, housekeeping entered my room. Apparently, Amalya, who said she�d let housekeeping know, never told her. I would�ve given them a 4 but for Amalya. It�s close to Javits but there are 3 more hotels 1 block away. Funny how one person can undo a good feeling about your stay.

"When I arrived, the room I was given wasn't the room type I had requested on Hotels.com. I went back down to the front desk and was then given the correct room type.
 
 The room was great overall. Excellent modern decor with bed, desk, bathroom, fridge. Lots of floor space (which is sometimes hard to tell from online photos). The shower was excellent but used a TON of water. The in-room thermostat worked great for being there in the winter. 
 
 I have one privacy complaint. Out the window is another hotel or apartment currently being furnished. Their staff were going into rooms that didn't have blinds. The blinds in my bathroom were a bit crumpled, so I felt a little, well, exposed. It also seemed weird to have Venetian blinds in the bathroom (including IN the shower). They may have been in the middle of getting new blinds.
 
 As for the morning: I had also assumed breakfast was part of my stay. The buffet was $20. That's expensive, but not unheard of. But the seating/dining expectations in the restaurant were unclear. It seemed like a self-seating restaurant, and the buffet was laid out for self-serve. When I asked the waitstaff, though, they assigned me a specific table and seemed slightly offended when I had gotten up to get my own coffee. With better signs I may have been a better customer.
 
 This was my first time in New York City. Had a blast and was thankful to stay at a hip hotel like Tryp.

The way it was portrayed in the site and the reality is different. The breakfast could be improved. You wait in line to serve yourself plus they could improve in quality food . The orange juice are not original, it is very cheap and they could have more choices in the breakfast. Very poor breakfast.

Asked to clean the room while I was out (from 10 am till 3pm) but was not cleaned. The cleaner came at 3:30 pm when I was taking a break, so I asked to come back at 5pm.

"This is our second stay. The hotel staff are lovely but have now been restricted by the New Management that took over about a month ago. No kettle or coffee making facilities in the room. That�s an extra $25 per night. No help with luggage, that�s another policy change & $5 per bag to store if you have a later flight. 
 On the positive side, location is great, rooms clean, and all 3 restaurants & bars are great. Beware also of the daily room taxes which are now over $30 per day. 
 If you are prepared for this then the Hotel is great. I did complain about the lack of help with the luggage & this was dealt with promptly by the Guest Service Manager. Thank you. We are a family of 4 that stayed for 2 weeks so had a lot of bags!
 I would like to thank the staff. Shame on the Management. We will not be staying again or recommending you.

This policy is not on their website, and it is not in the booking or confirmation email that we received. We did finally get our room, but we did not particularly appreciate them canceling our room, making us wait for some time, telling us we should come back to check in at 3pm (even though we had the reservation the night before as well, and should have been able to check in whenever), and then lying to us about a policy that didn�t exist.

"This property is excellent for its location. It is across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and only a 5 minute walk from Empire State Building, Macy�s and Times Square. The Tick Tock diner is excellent for breakfast every morning and very popular. However, the price that you are quoted online before you go will not be the same price when you leave. As with a lot of U.S. hotels, there are local taxes and charges applied when booking out. There�s also a $29 charge a night facility fee. When I queried this, I was told it was for use of hotel facilities such as the gym, business Centre and WiFi. I have an issue with paying for facilities that I did not use. Also, when we were given the WiFi details, it pops up on your phone as �high speed FREE WiFi�. Obviously not. Also if you arrive before your check in time, expect to pay $5 per bag to put bags aside if you want to walk around while waiting to check in. I have stayed in the New Yorker many times in the last 10 years and I cannot fault it for its location and safety and security but there are a lot of hidden extras and charges when checking in and out.

I asked for one to make hot water and they wanted to charge $25 per night for a small tea making machine. 
 The heating makes the room very dry. 
 Only good thing about this hotel is the location but there are plenty other hotels in the area so I�d choose some other hotel nearby.

"Love the location for its proximity to the Disney Races. Check in staff was awesome. Only annoying thing was housekeeping. I ran the Half Marathon and asked for a late checkout so I could shower before driving home. My husband was in the room and housekeeping tried to make up the room twice before 8am. He placed the Do Not Disturb in the door and came to pick me up after the race. Once we returned, the Do Not Disturb sign had blown off the door and in the hour and 1/2 we were still in the room, housekeeping tried 2 more times to make up the room. We felt very rushed and pressured to leave which was frustrating after a 13 mile run.

When I returned to my room around 5:00 PM, the dishes were set in the bushes outside of my room door. Obviously the maid has set them there earlier when clearning the room but no one had picked them up.
 
 On night two of my stay, I called room service three times, no answer. I then called the front desk and told them I could not reach room service. They said they would contact room service and have them call my room. After 45 minutes, no call. I then called room service again, no answer. I decided to order via Uber Eats instead.

"Great location. You really can�t beat it. You can easily walk to Disney Springs, and there were buses to the parks. This was the reason for our visit so it worked out well. 
 
 The room itself was dated and had a funny chemical smell like it may have previously been a smoking room a long time ago and the carpets had been cleaned many times to try to get the smell out. Beds were clean. Bathroom was not, the toilet was dirty when we arrived. 
 
 The pool area was fun, but difficult to access. It took us a while to figure out how to get out there because of lack of signs and it seamed like you had to go out a service area to get to the pool area. No grand entrance and just a little confusing. But once on the pool deck there were things for the kids to do and a nice big pool and hot tub. 
 
 The lobby area is nice and updated. There was a bar, breakfast and ice cram area. Staff was friendly and check in was fast and efficient, however the woman working at the desk that checked us in could not clearly explain in English how to get to our room and drew circles all over the hotel map, which also didn�t help. We found our room on our own following general signs, but she easily I could have said �pass the elevators and to your left, outside�. Again, just a little confusing for a first time guest.

Once at the front desk I told them the situation & showed pics and the young woman called someone to fix the issue & said it would be taken care of right away. When we returned from dinner it was still dirty and it was late so I didn�t bother calling about it again. Also the room was a handicap room so no tub for my 5 year old and it was right next to the door opening to the hallway so it was very loud hearing people going in & out and opening & closing the main door all night. Minor things really but the dirty sink should have been taken care of.

"SV is a very expensive place for a hotel to operate I'm sure, so I want to be understanding. Staff was GREAT, and the room & bathroom were clean. My issue is that ""Wyndham"" is a name that (to me) is synonymous with a certain level of luxury, but this hotel is very dated and certainly not what I would consider luxurious. Unfortunately, staying somewhere 'newer' would come with a FAR higher price tag. That being said, the bed was comfortable and I slept like a stone. The shower head was in desperate need of replacement, but the towels were soft. It was fine...but I do expect more from anything bearing the Wyndham name. All things considered, sure, I'll likely stay here again....just with more realistic expectations.

The following day I was checked in efficiently, but the staff was not at all friendly. The room was nice and clean. The bar staff was horrible. Although they were not busy, we waited while the girl chatted, cleaned, ignoring our presence....finally, we called to her and she took our order. She was not personable or friendly and acted as if we were bothering her for requesting a drink. I asked for a Long Island Iced Tea. It was humorous watching her make it as she requested assistance from another staff member who finished making the drink. It was undrinkable. When I told her that something was amiss and I couldn't drink it, she said ""All the ingredients are in there"" and walked away! I was speechless. I told the other staff member, who appeared to be training her. He motioned to her to take my drink. I then asked for a Vodka Cranberry and no one ever made it for me until I asked a third time! A couple down the bar couldn't believe what they were seeing and neither could we! The ONLY staff that was friendly was Housekeeping. Although it's a good location, I will never stay there again.

"This place is managed poorly. Quality control and attention to detail are lacking. They basically see how much they can get away with and do as little as possible. My first room was dirty. I complained so they moved me to another room. In the next room, some of the bathroom lights were busted and the water pressure was so low in the faucet that it took 5 minutes to get soap off your hands...not to mention the tub also drained slowly. They said they have never had a customer that has had so many issues and gave me the standard lip service. Yea...right.... It is clearly a management issue...they just don't care. I will never reserve a Wyndham hotel again.

"Beware!! We stayed at the Wyndham for a work stay. The first night was just ok but i woke up with a horrible back issue. When i arose from the bed you could hear the springs pop. Left for work and put the Service room card on the door. When we returned we noticed that a spot that was on the sheets was there again. I also sleep with earplugs in my ears and when we noticed the spot i pulled back the sheets and found my earplugs in the bed which told me that the sheets were not changed. When i called down to the front desk, Jordan answered the phone. I asked if servicing the room and not changing the sheets was customary he asked if i wanted housekeeping to come up to change the sheets and i replied that i wanted to know why it wasnt done in the first place to which he replied ""i have no idea i dont work in housekeeping"" He was rude and snarky and in no way tried to calm the situation. Housekeeping came up and called the keeper from the a.m to tell her what happened at which time i told her i had pictures which killed the convo. Left us uneasy about how long sheets were on that bed and whether the towels were clean or just refolded from our previous days use. The next morning my back was worse but checked out with a $50 credit. The morning staff person was kind and apologetic but Jordan needs a different line of work. Hospitality is NOT for him! I won't be returning to this location. Room not work the rate.

"The room itself was spacious and had the amenities we needed. However, the resort was split into different units around a main conference center and that wasn�t expected. The most frustrating part is that the cleaning staff knocked on our door at 9 am, woke us up, and then attempted to enter the room even thought our checkout wasn�t until 11 am. It was just frustrating because there was no notice that the cleaning staff would even be coming in at that time.

Staff was a little abrupt and cold, not giving a guest a warm and welcome feeling, more like we were an intrusion. I was told I was getting a room with a view, but view has to be taken with grain of salt as there was only a sliver of the city's skyline that could be seen from the room - better than nothing but I wouldn't characterize it as a room with a view. Other than that, I really enjoyed it's proximity to all that I wanted to see in NYC, and the cost did not break the bank.

She spoke with manager and came back to ask if I wanted to have breakfast there the next morning. I informed them that I was leaving at 6 a.m. and she sent out the manager after a while. He seemed inconvenienced that I was unhappy for not getting the room I booked. He just kept shrugging and saying, ""We don't have the room you booked available."" He refunded my resort fee. Went back to room to get ready for bed to find something spilled down the side of the nightstand and hair in both the sink and tub. The tub had huge chunks peeling from it. The resort is more of a motel style with rooms facing the outside and the noise was significant. I was just glad I was only staying for a very short period.

Too bad they completely cleaned the room before the professionals came, thereby removing any evidence. After being fully charged it took us over a week to get the manager on the phone to sort out a refund. I�ve never encountered such terrible customer service. I had the chance to stay an extra night due to a flight cancellation and I did not take it. Additionally, male cleaning staff in the hallway made disgusting inappropriate remarks as we walked by.

 Would definitely stay again.
 I read the reviews before we booked, all I gotta say is you need to make your own opinion. My opinion is this was one of the best hotel stays yet.

The overall room was clean and the furniture and tv where in very good condition. The bathroom was clean and good working order. The mirror had slight damage in the top left hand corner but wasn�t broken. The rug probably could use some cleaning. The biggest problem was the door had a big gap at bottom which was letting cold air in.

When we complained they offered two other rooms which were in the same condition which reflects the overall poor cleaning of the hotel. We wanted a refund so we could go somewhere else but the night manager Alex refused to accommodate us. He was not nice and was difficult to work with. Robert was really nice and tried helping us out but Alex wouldn�t allow it. Unfortunately we were forced to stay because they wouldn�t allow us to get a refund and leave. Worst last night in Cali. First and LAST time ever staying at a Wyndham hotel. Will not recommend to anyone.

"We were excited for a quick weekend trip to NYC this past weekend and excited for our stay at TRYP, based on the photos shown. Unfortunately, while the overall aesthetic was there, upon closer inspection the rooms were not nearly as clean and kept up as shown. Wallpaper was peeling, hair on bed sheets and pillows and overall the floors looked/felt dirty. I usually overlook little things, but when it comes to the cleanliness of the bathroom, that's where I get really picky. The floor tiles were moldy, the wall tiles were moldy, the soap/shampoo dispenser that had been broken off the wall was dirty and moldy...just not cool imo.
 
 The location of the property is excellent though, with a short 15-20 min walk to Times Square and right down the block from main subway lines. The staff was helpful as well, just wish the condition of the rooms were nicer and kept up. I was expecting a newly renovated room as shown, but got presented with a renovated room that needed a lot of love and cleaning.
 
 Not sure I'll stay here again, but will probably stay in this area of NYC again.

"My daughter and I did a quick two day one night trip to Disney. We stayed on the sunrise side of the exterior rooms. I have no problem with that but there were only sheer curtains to the windows and no black out curtains to block the room. That made me very uncomfortable to stay in a room without the additional curtains with just the two of us there without my husband coming with. There was also a parking lot light that would shine into the room that I would say kept me from sleeping that night. There was only 1 body towel to use after showers, I had to use two almost three towels to dry off after my shower. The water to the shower did not get hot at all. Only the bathroom sink got hot water. I had to pay for parking while there is a small booklet that comes with the room keys that says to save $20 to not park at the theme park and to park at the hotel. The room is also dated. The location of the hotel is great with it being walking distance to Disney Springs.

Also they individually wrap disposable cups in plastic, which seems as quite the overkill.

There is a gift shop (with Disney items), a small food/coffee shop, a bar and a restaurant. We couldn�t ask for more.

"Excellent price and value, close to all San Jose city locations. Unhappy with Desk, showed up at 11 am to check in due to afternoon and evening schedule, female allowed me to complete process with no room assignment, no clean rooms available. Ask me room location preference, I ask for first flloor. I arrived back at hotel 10pm. I was asked for ID and then given a 3rd floor room

"Booked hotel for three days and two nights through Hotels.com for a staycation with my girlfriend. After checking in, the next day we found out the hotel charged us additional for the three days and two nights (they charged us for their nightly rates which is more than doubled than what we paid for on Hotels.com -- $600) when we have only been informed that they were just going to charge the security deposit ONLY. Spoke to the front desk in a polite, respectful manner in regards to it and no apology was issued -- just an ""Oh it looks like we did charge you extra. We'll just refund your card and you should receive it by the end of the week."" We spoke to another guest at the hotel as we were waiting in line and apparently, this happened to them as well (they were charged $900 extra). When we brought this up again to the front desk, one of the front desk clerk (a mid-aged asian lady) criticized us OUT LOUD to all the guest in the lobby that ""it's not even a lot of money. You should have more money than that on your credit card anyways.""
 .......
 Horrible Service. Would not stay here again.

Just said they were sorry!! Our flight was cancelled 3 times due to weather and the manager gave us an hour to extend our check out time even though our new flight was at 9pm! Nothing was offered as a combo for any issues. Our breakfast was awful too!! Only good part is Starbucks! We had issues last yr here as well but figured we�d give them another chance but NEVER AGAIN! When I told them we would never return along with hundreds of other families who come twice a year for this event they responded �ok�! That proves they don�t appreciate their guest or our business!!! I never complain but this time I had to share!

"The place was very old. They charge a $25 resort fee and a $25 parking fee so add $50 to whatever price they quote. It ends up being cheaper to stay at a Disney value hotel and they are much much nicer. It is very old and like a motel. My heater didn�t work and housekeeping didn�t clean one day because we left a few things on the bed. We actuator a letter stating that if we left anything on the bed they won�t clean the room. This was more of a 2 star hotel and I never stay at anything less than a 3. The lobby is nice and the hotel shampoo was good. You do get extra Magic Hours at this hotel and they have transportation to the parks.

Could not reach front desk via room phone. Next morning complained after horrible night sleep was moved to ""newer"" building and advised building we originally were put in is scheduled for demolition. Needless say were given a $24 room resort fee credit for the inconvenience. Overall not satisfied. Website makes place to look better than actually is. My kids stayed locally at Marriot for same rate few blocks away same night much better hotel.

"This hotel was built in 1929 and even though it has been updated (somewhat), much of it is the same as it was 90 years ago. Many of the rooms are so small, they're more like a cage. The bathrooms are so small, there is little to no room for a shaving kit. The toilet looks like the ones they probably have at Riker's. And because it's all original plumbing, it's nearly impossible to get the shower to a reasonable temperature. I suppose this is common in NYC, but next time, I'm not likely to stay there. By the way, the service was very good. Everyone was helpful. The facility is the only issue.

Clean Quality Sheets and room was nice for an old hotel w/ small rooms. Wifi good. Heater left a bit to be desired and water pressure was a bit low (which keeps bathroom maintenance issues / mold to a minimum). Location not terrible for business. Leave early morning and come back late night - so who cares that it isn't in the heart of midtown. Would stay again!

"I reserved a suite & requested an extra roll-away bed/cot.
 The reservation included free breakfast.
 
 At checkin, the person behind the reception (Alex) was very unhelpful and wouldn't agree to arrange the extra bed. He told me to change to a double-queen room without adjusting the price. After arguing with him for 10-min, he said the sofa in the suite was a sofa-bed & sent someone to open it.
 
 The reservation included a free breakfast. Again the same person argued that my reservation didn't have it. He added it to the reservation only after I showed him my confirmation email.
 
 On the second day, the house-service didn't make the beds, change the towels or empty the trash. The reception just handed me the towels to take.
 
 Overall, the experience at the hotel was terrible & not worth the price paid.
 
 On the redeeming side, the breakfast at the Summit bar & grill was excellent. The service was friendly.

That isn�t the problem, my problem was with the gentleman that was at the front desk. He was rude and short with me for no reason, instead of trying to help me he sent me on my way so I can figure out what happened. Once I called the website and everything was figured out. He finished checking me, not once was he friendly. He didn�t even direct me to my room he had me look it up on the map.

"The ratings are mixed because we originally reserved the ""garden"" section of the hotel. The rooms are cheaper there but we were not happy at all. The room was clean but there was space under the door, not access to an electrical outlet near the bed and old furniture. We asked to be moved to the main (""tower"") section of the hotel. It cost us an additional $50.00 per night but was so much better. If you stay here, avoid the garden section but be prepared to pay more. Nothing but good things to say about our stay after we were moved.

Front desk couldn't find my reservation at first, so my dad called me and eventually the employee found it. They were very courteous and apologized, but maybe not so organized? First room's toilet had low water pressure and was not flushing properly, and eventually my parents were moved to another room which thankfully worked. Rest of the stay was okay, and breakfast was good, but check-in could have been a much smoother process. Room is definitely small - but I don't know if that's typical of NY. King size bed is against the wall on one side, and small sitting area on the other side. View was great -- unobstructed view of Queens and Manhattan skyline.

"Clean, quite and kid friendly. Nice hot tub, work out room and heated pool. Courteous staff- always had genuine smiles and were ready to help. 4 blocks to Disney entrance- easy walk and totally worth it. We had relatives staying at hotels closer to Disney- they paid more for noisy, old rooms. We ate dinner at House of Blues located in the Garden Walk (open mall) next to this hotel- it had great atmosphere and service. My 7 year old enjoyed playing at Billy Beez (indoor play area) next to House of Blues. We ate breakfast at the IHop across from Disney- it was $86 for two kids meals, plain pancakes and a basic egg dish- no drinks! The next morning we ate at Mimi's Cafe just a couple more blocks down and it was great- affordable and yummy. You can get 4 of their amazing muffins to go for $8! When you enter Disney stay to the left- you will be tempted to go to the first line you see- don't. They all go to the same spot. Over ride your instincts and go to the lines all the way to the left. If you have a bag it will take you three times as long to get in due to extra security. Single rider is the way to go and the $10 add on virtual max pass is great! I even did single rider with my kids- saved us hours and they were sold after they got over the initial fear of being in a different car than me. I just made sure I went first so I was waiting when they got off.

"After being lost from the ramp to the lobby. Was not told where to go, walking back and forth. After 20min being lost finally found the room as I walk in the room it had a very strong odor.. found out it came from the bathroom. Like a wet mold odor. After bring in the room for like 5min I couldn�t handle the smell. It was bad. so I went to the lobby and told them their is a strong smell.. didn�t even hear �sorry to hear that� or anything.. I told them can I get another room. She said ok. I would figure an upgrade for the inconvenience or some kind of Complementary.. very bad customer service.. not a good way to treat your guest... your guest should not have to go through that coming from a 4star hotel.

"Also von au�en sieht das Hotel top aus. Das Zimmer allerdings, war ziemlich klein und die M�bel teilweise in einem unm�glichen Zustand! Die Schubladen gingen st�ndig von selbst wieder auf!
 Das allernervigste war, dass man jedesmal bevor man in den Aufzug steigen wollte, seine Zimmerkarte vorzeigen musste. Wir waren 9 Tage in dem Hotel und m�sste 3 Mal t�glich die Karte vorzeigen... Einmal haben wir es gewagt, uns 10 Minuten in der Hotellobby hinzusetzen. Sofort kam einer an und fragte uns ob wir Hotelg�ste seien. Nachdem ich es best�tigte, wurde ich aufgefordert meine Karte zu zeigen. Wir haben uns gef�hlt wie Schwerverbrecher...! Ich war schon in vielen Hotels auf der Welt, auch in viel besseren als das Wyndham z.B. Hilton. Und noch nie wurde ich so behandelt. Das war eine Frechheit!
 Noch schlimmer das dazugeh�rige Tic Toc Restaurant, wo man GEZWUNGEN wird t�glich ein ordentliches Trinkgeld hinzulegen. War zweimal dort, das hat mir gereicht!

"Overall our stay was great. The room was spacious by NYC standards, and the bed super comfy. The WiFi was non-existent in my room, but I wasn't there to surf the web, so that wasn't too big a deal. I have only one real complaint: I arrived around 11 a.m. hoping to check in early if a room was available, but was told there would be a $50 early check-in fee! I don't know if this is common now or not - I've never come across it - but don't understand the logic. If you have rooms available, isn't it in the hotel's best interest to stagger check-ins so you don't have hundreds of people in your lobby trying to check-in right at 3 p.m.? I declined to pay this, and was able to store my bag for the afternoon. And the woman at the front desk did switch me to a double room without charging me, which I really appreciated. But still, that $50 fee seems like a bad idea.

"Booked for a family weekend getaway to Disney World. Gave us a room on the 5th floor. Parking $20 per night. We got in about 8:30pm so after bringing luggage upstairs sent kids to get showers. Shower does not have hot water even though sink does. Took 7 tries to get registration to answer the phone and says no other rooms are available but will send up maintenance. Maintenance works for 24 minutes and gets water to slightly warm after water has been running for about 45 minutes. Go to parks early for magic hours and registration did not give the necessary �blue card� verification so we have to go to guest relations and end up missing magic hours. Never again.

"I booked this hotel 4 months prior to my stay booked a balcony with a view. I also called to make sure staff received the reservation and my request for a view of the lake, called again 3 days prior my stay to confirm my request and all was great according to the staff. I have a baby and we were anticipating the view of fireworks on New Year�s Eve from the balcony of the hotel. 
 Well to my surprise when we checked in we received the complete opposite of what we booked. Unhappy about the situation I agreed to wait for a different room. Waited 3 hrs, received a new room worse than the first. By then it was almost 9pm when we received the keys to the 3er room this one they called it an upgraded but off course still not what I asked for. We were so tired of waiting and frustrated we took the room, only to find a clogged toilet. I ended up dealing with it because by then it was new year. 
 The next day we checked out and moved to Disney property. 
 This hotel is nice but if you are going to spend this much money for a room stay at Disney you will not be disappointed. The food at this hotel is soo over priced $80 for cheese burger for 3 don�t do it! 
 Also very miss leading information and the view of fireworks is very disappointing. Parking cost more than Disney. Between the price for the night food and parking we spent at this hotel more than we actually spent in Disney with a dinnig plan included. After spending 40 nights traveling this year I can�t recommend this property.

 On our room the AC was not working properly, we got to wait one hour for them to fix it.
 
 We also requested a late checkout before our reservation, while checking-in and the day we left. The hotel staff was not able to provide information on this, just kept telling us it was under availability even though the hotel is empty.
 
 Overall it was a negative experience, the hotel manager was disrespectful and unwilling to help. The staff at the front desk in unfriendly and hangs up the phone.

It had a huge indentation, showing its age. My husband did not enjoy his sleep at all. The black outs in the room also had some damage. The hotel grounds and lobby are pretty sharp. The interior of the guestrooms could benefit from some updating, also.

When we informed it was through Expedia she said, ""Oh, so 1st or 2nd level because we don't provide elevators"", she did not welcome us, she didn't even smile. She gave us the key cards and that was it. Then the doors in each room had to be shut so hard they would wake everyone up. Wouldn't stay there again.

"We only stayed one night as we had an overnight layover. The staff and shuttle driver were friendly enough. My son really loved Monte. The hotel room itself was very run down. The chair was falling apart, the paint was peeling and the room smelled musky. I was afraid to touch anything and seriously considered finding another place to stay even though it was 1 in the morning. I did not feel comfortable or safe at all with my two small children (3 year old and 8 week old). I could not wait to leave that place in the morning and hope I didn�t pick up any bed bugs. This hotel is the type of place that drug deals go down in-at least it felt that way.

"I really enjoyed the fact that this property was right in the heart of International Drive. However, the property is not what it seems. While staying there, the cable was out. When contacting the front desk, you have to call multiple times for someone to pick up. The property sits in the open, seeing as it is made up of multiple buildings. There is no elevator, so if you are on the second floor of the building, you must carry your bags up to two-theee flights of stairs. It is loud, the doors, rooms and property is outdated. Doors continuously slam all night, the walls are thin to the point where you can hear into your neighbors room. There is no security on the property so since the gates do not lock and are not controlled accessed, anyone can walk up to your room door. The front desk is not really as helpful and this property is extremely outdated, including the beds, furniture in the rooms as well as simple things like the blow dryers. I would not stay here.

There's a large fridge in the rooms which is nice and the fitness center is actually pretty decent.

"The pictures on the website/ any hotels.com etc. platform are completely misleading. The room was over half the size of the photos, the bathroom was a quarter of the size advertised, the curtains were incredibly dusty, there was no fridge, no games console, no iPod dock as promised/ advertised. Daily housekeeping was dreadful, the same dirty pillow cases were just turned over every day, the duvets supplied were dirty, we were told we'd been ""upgraded"" to a King bed deluxe, which is even more alarming considering the size of the room was half that advertised of a Queen bed deluxe room. The room had a door leading to the next room in the room despite this apparently only being available ""if asked for"", you could hear everything the other guests were saying, even if a cough as the room is so small and walls are so thin the bed is right by the other guest's door. The waiter monitoring breakfast was incredibly rude and aggressive; especially if he feels you aren't going to tip him what he wants. The only good thing about the hotel was the location, but I'm sure you could get another hotel for the same price and the same distance to the main ""times square"", (probably can get one right by ""times square"") which actually gives you the value of the money you paid and service advertised/ entitled to for a 4.5* hotel. The doors in the room leading to the bathroom had chunks taken out of it, the bed also had chunks missing from the frame, it is NOT a luxury hotel.

The parking lot was connected to a gas station which was very busy and cars went extremely fast thru the at some times one lane parking lot. The bathroom had hair in the shower when we checked in. When we needed to get in touch with the lobby, we most of the time couldn't get thru to them. Our last night there our key wouldn't work to let us in the main hall. My husband called the lobby to tell them. We had to wait outside for approximately 20 minutes for them to come let us in.

Our room's door would not close unless you smash it. And it's hard to tell by looking. So we went dinner for a whole 2 hour, not knowing the door is actually open. The AC in our room is intentionally locked and could not be turned on until the mechanic came by. The fire alarm beeped all through the night for low battery. We called the front desk about it, but no one showed up that night. Above all, it is not a decent resort, but merely a motel locates at the side of a road.

"From the moment we walked in this was not what we expected. The lobby was dingy, old and dirty. There was not a sense of welcome felt at all. The check in service was horrible. The staff was rude, did not explain the hotel or facilities, did not explain additional fees. 
 Once we headed to the room as soon as the elevator doors opened we were more disappointed. There was peeling paint, dirty walls and carpet and a horrible smell. The room was even worse. The carpet did not feel clean, the walls were dingy, the bathroom was not clean. The mattress looked old and outdated. During our stay the hot water stopped working multiple times and required us to call several times. Only once did maintenance show up. 
 The lobby staff was not helpful, were always mad and very unfriendly. My daughter is on crutches and we asked to use the lobby restroom. There weas only an escalator and they did not have an accessible means to reach the restroom. The security staff was unhelpful and they thought we may be able to use the service elevator. 
 
 We spoke to the manager and he was very unhappy and did not seem to care about our concerns. This hotel was a bid disappointment. We expected more from a Wyndom and more for the price we paid

The side rooms facing the parking lot is so old, dirty and bad it feels like you are staying at a cheap motel. After checking in at 3:00pm we went straight to Disney Springs walking- I came back at 11:00pm our shower didn�t work, the fridge was noisy. So went to the lobby complained they changed my room- we moved all of our luggage to the new room- guess what another horrible room- went back down to the lobby and by now 3 other guests were there complaining. Finally they put us in a let�s juat say decent room. 
 
 I only know about the tower rooms because we had a couple traveling with us that stayed in the tower. Amazing room- clean- big- quiet!!! 
 
 Ps. One side of the hotel is direct to parking lot ( OH YOU PAY EXTRA $15,00 per DAY FOR PARKING YOUR CAR!) the other side is the VALET PARKING they keep beeping the car horns to find them all day and night horrible!
 
 I only recomend this hotel if you book your room in the TOWER!!!!

My room is always clean and because of my past stays, I was upgraded to an even better suite. It�s not to far from any of the main attractions and right next door to a good convient store. I recommend to anyone who doesn�t want to deal with so much traffic but still be close to everything.

"The hotel staff were really friendly. The Lobby was clean, as were the elevators and hallways. The room was clean but calling it a room seems a stretch. An oversized closet would be a more appropriate description. The entry door swing came within inches of the back of the room. Of all the places I've traveled I've never stayed in a closet. Even more annoying than the tiny room was the poorly hung shower curtain. The curtain rod was placed to the inside of the tubs edge. So not only are you in a shower about the size of a travel trailer but the curtain touches and sticks to you the entire time. The afternoon of our second day we returned to our closet around 5 only to find that the cleaning service had skipped us. Luckily the cleaning lady was just down the hall so getting fresh towels was easy but it was none the less disappointing. I didn't spend a fortune but I definitely paid more than enough to get a room, not closet and clean towels. Thank goodness I wasn't there to spend much time in the room. The area around the hotel has adequate options for food that are within walking distance. I stress walking because there's little to no parking around the hotel. The hotel offers parking, at $25 per night. I paid it one night but the space I was told to park in took me almost 20 minutes to work into. I felt like Austin Powers trying to get my vehicle turned into the spot. The next day I had to drive over the curb to exit because of the way other vehicles were parked around me.

"Hotels.com did not specify that it is an outdoor hotel. It is cold in Orlando and the pool is not heated. The rooms looked great in photos but were run down and did not have central A/C. The lobby is separate from the rooms, but they do give you a free parking pass. They charged my card on file despite already paying in person at the hotel. It is close to Universal and the Orlando Preminum Outleta but about 25 mins from Disney Epcot. No accommodations or discounts for being service members.

"The location is great, the staff was nice and friendly, our only issue was with the room. The walls seemed paper thin, based on us being able to hear everything in the room next to us, even though they were not talking particularly loudly. There were very few options for lighting...one random light fixture was hanging from the ceiling over the bed (lopsided and not centered over the bed) and two recessed lights in the ceiling. That was it, no side table lamps, no reading lamps, nothing. There was wallpaper peeling off the wall, and the bed linens were sub-par. The heating and cooling unit was very noisy and right near my head while I slept. There were no bureaus are other kinds of drawers to put clothing away.

"As someone who also works in customer service, it took one of the valet gentlemen to make our stay more hospitable. The front desk may need a refresher on social queues and communication. During my check-in and my return from picking up my fiance from the airport, the front desk was nor rude or friendly. Also, the room was very TIGHT. It's as if they tried to live a minimalist life. I understand we were there for one night but we were disappointed with the space. I don't intend on visiting here again nor do I advise anyone who actually wants to stay in their room to stay here. It is honestly good for somewhere to leave your things, shower, and sleep. The room was clean, they have outdated vending machines (it is 2018, why are we not using card machines??), and I felt like the rooms were secure to leave your belongings. PRO TIP: pay attention to the diagram taped down on top of the front desk; it is how you use the shower. Seriously.

The sink had standing water in it when we arrived. The room was dirty. In general. Beware if you book here the pics you see are not the rooms you get. The staff isn't very rude. We had a package delivered there prior to our arrival. Once fed ex delivered I called to confirm they said yes we have it. Upon check it they did not have any idea what were talking about the after arguing they said oh yea it's in reviving we will send it right up after two hours they informed us that receiving was closed and we would have to wait til the next day. Then at 11:45 pm they said well you can come get it if you want I guess. Tried to reach mgt but was told no one was available. Had hotels.com try to reach the hotel and it even took them two hours to try to reach someone at the property. Thank god for hotels.com the got me early check ou with refund and moved to a lot nicer hotel even though it was not a ""4 star resort"" the new hotel was 100% a lot nicer place to stay I will never stay at this place again and I will advise everyone's I know to stay far away from here thank you hotels.com for saving our vacation

We have stayed at many hotels from very high end to lower and have never been charged. What was really upsetting was that when we picked up the bags and paid the $10 pick up, our change out of $20 was given in $1 bills. When we asked for it to be in a bigger note, the bell hop rudely replied no bigger notes, we should just tip him. The bags were literally 5 steps away and all he did was bring them out and drop them. Seriously the service was so bad, he should have given us a tip. Cheers

"We liked how close the property is to Disney Springs and that you can take a shuttle to and from the parks. Although it is frustrating that the busses only come every 30 minutes. The snack bar was very overpriced, what I would expect for an amusement park, not a hotel. 
 Our room was so dirty with dead fruit flies everywhere, stains on the floor and a loud vent. The night we got there I requested A room upgrade and the staff was very rude and said call back tomorrow. We went to the park all day the next day so we were unable to get to the front desk and had decided to just deal with it and never stay there again. I know We reserved the base room, but normally the base rooms offered on Expedia have been great at other hotels. At checkout is when i overheard another unhappy woman asking for a new room, she was told that when you see �Garden� that means you are getting a basic room, on the first floor and I guess Not a clean room either.

 Easy to use all modes of NYC transportation, with the subway right at the corner. 
 Upgrading the guest towels would be an easy thing for the hotel to do... otherwise the towels feel like sandpaper. Soft close mechanisms on the doors would be a nice addition as it got really loud with guests not being mindful of the noise level that the doors make upon closing. Hot water can take some time to reach your room, but when it gets there its fine. Morning breakfast buffet was just ok and the lobby bar was actually nice and relaxing, making it a good place to rendezvous with other folks. There is good food very near by.

"Overall the hotel was good. There is no parking in the area and so they charge you $25 a night for parking. That is okay but they kid that went to pull out my car could hardly drive and almost hit a wall. On top of that they park your car either in front or in the adjacent garage so there really is no need for the valet. 
 Although the rooms were comfortable and reasonably clean, I noticed that they were not clean consistently. One day it was very noticeable that the floor had not been swept (they are not carpet so everything shows) and the bathroom sink had not been cleaned thoroughly. I noticed but it was not a giant deal to me and I was tired so I did not go down and report it. I probably should have.
 
 My trip was not for pleasure so the location was fine but, if you are coming to see NYC, I can see that the location might be a bit problematic.
 
 Overall though my stay was good.

"Location! This hotel is in a prime location. It is steps from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Easy walk to the Theatre district, and Time Square. The building is a historical building and they are very good at showcasing the history of the hotel to include an exhibit. The rooms are smaller, but you have to remember this is a historical building in which the architecture is to be admired and appreciated. The rooms were very clean and the staff was absolutely wonderful!!! I would absolutely return!

"Check In experience was the worst of any hotel I have ever checked into period, and I stay in at least two hotels per month.
 
 I was very excited to stay here and was left bitterly disappointed by the hotel staff and policies for early check in.
 
 Check in is 3:00pm. I arrived at the hotel at 12:45 pm and asked of the possibility of checking in early, they said yes...for a fee of $50 USD. They went on say I could check in at 2:00 pm at no charge. So for 1hr 15mins they wanted to charge me $50 USD for a room that is already costing $390 USD per night! When I said no thank you to spending the extra money I asked what would happen to the room only to be told it would remain empty. Rather that give top class customer service to a potential repeat customer they chose instead to taint the experience to the point nor I or anyone in my family will every stay at Tryp again. I�m had a much better experience at the Even hotel which is located next door. 
 
 Terrible customer service.

"There is a double standard between the two towers. We initially got the garden tower. The room was drty. Smelled old and what is even worse the security was less than pathetic. Rooms open to the parking which was a open invitation to anybody from the streets.
 After seeing the dirty and unsafe room we paid extra and moved to the tower which offered a cleaner and safe room. I was perplexed to see the double standard between the two towers and the fact that they are irresponsible enough to even sacrify safety. I ended up paying far more that thw initial and quite honestly for the total ammount I spent, I would have stayed at the Hilton and I could have avoided the bad moment of the garden room. I will never go to that hotel again. Even the staff needs cuatomer service training.

"The best things about this hotel are location (easy walk to Penn Station) and staff, who are pleasant and accommodating. It can be helpful to have as it does a restaurant on the premises, as well. I have stayed here a few times due to location. For the price though, I think the very small room could have offered a coffee maker at least. I was able to get hot water for my bedtime tea at the restaurant but this was not convenient. Also no microwave or mini fridge. The pedestal sink made it a challenge for me to find a convenient place for toiletries though there was a shelf on the wall, designed perhaps for taller people than me. Perhaps small things to some, but they add up.

"First, I selected the option to pay upon arrival only to discover the payment was taken out right away. When we arrived I double checked with the front desk that everything was already paid and they verified it was. Nothing was mentioned at check in about the extra magic hours (which was the entire reason for selecting this hotel) and after calling the number for Disney they advised the front desk should have asked about the vouchers. I called from the phone in our room only to get the busy signal (tried for about 20-30 minutes). Upon check out I verified again that everything was taken care of and they assured me it was. No receipt offered. I checked my bank account again and found they deducted almost another $50 from my bank account only to be told by staff twice that everything was paid. When I called they said that was for parking, resort fees and tax. They would only refund the resort fee and taxes but not the parking in 7 to 10 days. Amazing they can take it out so quick but it takes awhile to get it back. Stay at an actual Disney resort next time it will be cheaper in the long run. The daily fee to park your car here is 15 per day.

I was disappointed that my prepaid cost didn't include $22 a night parking or $28 resort fee - another $50 a night wasn't included in my ""all paid"" in advance fee. Ordered Uber Eats and the hotel wouldn't allow them to park and bring the food up to our room when me and my 10 year old were sick with the flu. Also deeply disappointed that when I called the front desk at 1am to let them know my 10 year old was running 104 fever they wouldn't allow me to pay their NOT BUSY bellman to pick up childrens Tylenol. They would rather I drag an extremely sick child out in the middle of the night or leave her alone in the hotel room. Poor customer service in my opinion.

"My biggest issue with our stay was it was extremely difficult to sleep on Saturday night due to the party they were having in the hotel. We had woken up early for our drive and were super tired and just wanted to sleep, but it was difficult to drowned out the music, loud talking by people passing by our hotel room, and bright lighting. I am pretty low maintenance as far as my expectations for hotels, I mean I just want a clean and a safe place to rest. However, if I hadn�t been so tired I would have switched hotels, due to the lack of sleep we all got staying here. I was kind of surprised they would allow such a loud party with music to go on so late in their main facility being that rooms are so close to it. It was extremely frustrating to my teenage boys as well who needed to sleep because their volleyball tournament started again early on Sunday. We will not be staying here again, but I really hope they fix fire out a better way to block out noise and light if they are going to allow big parties in their facility in the evenings. Very disappointed with my stay here.

"Very clean hotel. Staff was friendly. Unfortunately, we could not walk to Epcot as planned as the walking paths were under construction which was disappointing as that is why we reserved to begin with. 
 Only the queen bed rooms have a bathtub, Kong�s don�t. Bathtub is required for toddlers. :-/
 Aside from that, the stay was good. I would return.

Bathrooms has urine or blood stain on tub side in 517 ..Smell was so foul coming from 505 bathroom. Staff member came in and said she would return and she didnt. Open shampoo and lotions containers in bathroom of 503 and wrapper from candy in window sill. Whoever worked the floor the night we stayed for housekeeping needs to be retrained.
 The front desk agent Kara was very helpful to making us move to another room as housekeeping was not available to clean the bathrooms.

"I�ve stayed at the property previously (2016) and had an amazing experience. I booked via Hotels.com and had a gorgeous room with a view of the grounds, a balcony, carpeted floors (not big on hardwood floors in hotel rooms) and a single bed. I arrived at the front desk and requested a single bed because I was expecting company but also don�t like to sleep in rooms alone with two beds; a qualm. The clerk gave pushback but ended up placing me in a subpar room to say the least, nothing like my first experience. I had a show the following day and some running around to do prior to so I wasn�t in the frame of mind for a lot of back and forth but this will be my last time booking this location. Most times when booking via the app hotels treat you like you came in off of the street and they�re giving you a room and you should be grateful for whatever accommodations they offer.

"When we arrived to the New Yorker it was quite a bit before check in and the staff was more than helpful and accommodating. We upgraded our room for a minimal fee and were quite satisfied with that decision. The room we were in had been recently renovated, had a good view and the hotel is close to Macy�s and Time Square. My biggest complaint is the bathroom. While pretty, it was always cold due to the tile and there was no counter space. That being said, I would definitely recommend staying at the New Yorker due to the overall experience.

"The lobby was beautiful. It looks like a gorgeous hotel from the lobby - when you go to your room it looks like a motel. Did not use the pool area but from viewing it - it really looks nice. Great customer service at check in.
 
 The reason for my visit was because my daughter is in the Disney College Program. Late Sunday I got a call that she was in the hospital after suffering multiple seizures. My flight arrived late Monday night & I went straight to the hospital. I called the hotel to let them know I would not be checking in that night. I had paid ahead of time for 4 nights. At check in they said they wouldn�t charge me for parking the first night since I wasn�t there. I didn�t expect to not be charged for the room for the first night since it was prepaid. 
 
 Complaints - the heat did not work in the room. I did not spend much time in the room, but when I did come back on the 2nd day it had only gone up to 66 degrees & housekeeping had not been to clean the room. I called the front desk to report the heat issue & housekeeping. Both did get fixed. I had to use the stairs - the elevator was broke the whole time. I had to leave at 4:00 am on Friday morning to catch my flight. I went to the front desk before I left & asked the gentlemen working if they could credit me for the resort fee for Monday since I didn�t stay there at all. I also told him about the heat, housekeeping & elevator. He plainly said There is nothing I can do you booked through Expedia take it up with them

"I am very unhappy having paid for 5 nights for a 4.5 star rated hotel and I was asked to move during the first night into a 3 star rated hotel. Which was not organised before my arrival and then the alternative accommodation was not the room size or bed occupancy I had paid for. One can appreciate having a child with you and having to go through this bad service is very challenging and inconvenient. I have always been catered to whilst waiting offered refreshments, entertainment for the child and due to the inconvenience given free room upgrades, neither were offered by TRYP.
 This holiday was a birthday surprise for my brother and to be honest the service we have received from TRYP had ruined our first day in NYC, not only was money lost but precious time also!!! Am still awaiting for management to acknowledge these issues and receive my refund!

I had to stand at the very back of the shower. A one position only shower. Thus, the floor got all wet. You need a shower head that can be positioned in different ways rather than stuck in one position. The sink was so small that when washing ones face the floor got all wet. The workout room was messy and lacking weights. The king size bed was v nice.

"Property is quite old. The lobby is very deceiving, The lobby has been updated. The rooms could use an update. 
 
 Pros:
 � Location, location, location. This property is pretty close to anything you need. The train, food, malls, & time square is not too far of a walk.
 � The diner stays open 24hrs. I got in way later than I had expected that due to some travel delays it was great to be able to get some food without having to leave the hotel.
 � The staff are all super nice and greet you with a smile.
 � Lots of options to eat and drink even within the building. So on those cold night no need to leave the building. (Steakhouse, Bar, Diner, & room service)
 
 Cons:
 � Rooms are small but that is not unusual for the properties in the city.
 � The TVs are older models that do not get many channels.
 � The beds yikes needs to be updated. The mattress we had the edges poked us so bad we jumped to avoid it each night.
 � You pay $30 a day resort services fee. It would be nice for the offered amenities were nice. They were average at best some subpar. The gym is ok. The business center is ok.
 � Price for what you get seems to be mismatched. Paid too much, for what you get. I would likely stay elsewhere next time. Since there are, other options are widely available.

"Hotel is nice. Staff are excellent. If youre not used to NYC living conditions, be prepared. Rooms are small. This is the smallest hitel room we have ever stayed in.
 The best thing about this hotel is location. You can walk to times square, Rockefeller center, broadway... or hop on a train or subway next door at penn station. We used the subways to get everywhere, and got on and off 500ft away from the hotel entrance. Even the LIRR train from JFK airport stops right there. That makes this hotel perfect for tourists coming to NYC to see the sights.

"If you�re simply looking for a place to stay that is inexpensive compared to the rest of the areas, you may be able to get away staying here. There is barebones minimal staff so much that it took literal begging to get extra towels with no in room services during certain hours. Probably wouldn�t stay here again, but it was close to the stadium and wasn�t too familiar with the area. All and all if you can afford to stay somewhere else i would recommend that. Staff doesn�t seem very apologetic of the lack of services but I guess you get what you pay for.

Thinking it was a bottle of water it was instead an offer to listen to a sales pitch of one of their properties. But the offer was only for singles so I�d have to remove my wedding ring. I was traveling alone at the time. They also charge a resort fee which includes transportation to the parks. Coming back from the Magic Kingdom it took the bus 50 minutes to make a 2 mile trip. It just sits and waits and waits. I finally get off the bus to find crime scene tape covering the front of the hotel and a busted plate glass window.

 Macys is just down the road, and a great Starbucks and Mcdonalds across the street. The hotel also has a diner ""Tick Tock"" for 24/7 food, which serves up really decent food.
 
 The room was spot on, really clean and well presented. Check in took no more than 5 minutes, and the security at the elevators gives you some comfort that not anyone can access the floors.
 
 WIFI ran at 10mbs up and down, which enabled us to keep in touch with work and do the occasional laptop activities. 
 
 We will 100% use this hotel again, you cannot fault our stay. The hotel look and feel gives that ""new york"" art deco (a little like ""hotel"" from AMS).

The only complaint is the $22/day for parking, and the $28/day resort fee. Although I'm sure all hotels charge this in Orlando now. I do suggest that they put a sign on the gate after you check out to push valet button to open the gate as it was a bit confusing on what to do because when you put your ticket in the slot it says to insert credit card, but we already paid for the parking.

"The evening staff was absolutely no help and just terrible in terms of assisting us to find parking. Even though we were inquired about valet parking earlier in the day the few parking spots were taken and we spent more than half hour looking for parking in the vicinity.. They should have told us about the parking problems when we arrived and we would have just secured valet parking earlier. The front desk ignored us at first and then basically said you are on your own - good luck! No offer to assist us where we could go and find street parking; we are Canadians so did not know the area and where to go - ended up parking 5 blocks away - just terrible. We could not sleep that night since it is NYC so enuff said. Will not book there again.

"Third time at the Wyndham, great hotel for what we wanted for our stay, but the resort charges and credit card holds are quite frankly off putting:
 Resort tax of $24 per day is quite frankly daylight robbery and merely covers the items that any hotel should cover anyway, we never had daily bottled water which in the tax.
 As for the credit card holds, the minute you check in they hold the amount of your stay straight away, plus they want another $40 a day security !!!!, apparently we should feel honoured that they only held one payment of $40 for our 7 day stay.
 I can only assume that the Wyndham Orlando has had a number of guests who have not settled bills historically, but treating every guest as a non paying risk is quite frankly insulting.
 My son still had a $400 hold on card three days after check out, he had to contact the reception at Wyndham Orlando from the UK by phone in order to resolve the matter, we had checked out with nothing to bill and no outstanding charges.
 Following this experience it will Air bnb for our next Florida trip.

"Overpriced, not clean, noisy, old. This hotel was terrible. Paid $500 for one night. The room was the size of a closet. The rooms are very old so you can hear a ton of noise from outside the window and hallway. Worst part was that there was dark long hair all over the bathroom floor, walls, toilet, and shower. I'm pretty sure it wasn't cleaned and was disgusting. 2 of the restaurants on site were closed for private events. My key card stopped working when I went to the gym. I didn't have my wallet/ID on me so I had to wait for security come up to the room which took a half hour. I would stay anywhere else in the area.

"Decided to save money at Disney by staying in one area hotels listed on hotels.com for 89.00 per night instead booking at Caribbean Beach. So glad I did. For the amount of time spent in the room versus being at one of the parks it was well worth the savings.The amenities at the hotel were the same as those at Caribbean resorts, cleanliness of the room and location to the parks were accessible by free shuttle service same as well. The only complaint i has was that the cleaning service was knocking at my door at 9am to clean the room for an 11am checkout. Front desk was going to knock some money off my bill but it was already prepaid. I felt that I could have pushed the issue for another type of compensation but the rest of my stay didn't warrant the need to do so.

You have to go all the way around the hotel just to get to your room since there are no alternate access points but the rooms were lovely. There is a lot of storage space in these rooms, we had a flat screen tv (didnt get great reception) and a mini fridge. The staff at the front desk was very nice and informative but housekeeping could use some work. They were cleaning the room next to us and were very loud for it being that early in the morning. Talking to each other loudly and cellphone ringing plus that was a loud conversation also. I think they should remember that people are sleeping. Overall we had a great time in san jose!

I don�t understand. After ma complain to Expedia they gave me another room just a bit bigger but still not the room I�ve booked on Expedia. 
 At the end I did not even had a refund or compasention of any king. The hotel or Expedia gave me nothing not a good experience. Won�t book again at that hotel or on Expedia.

We were quickly moved upon request but the new room was 2nd floor -no elevator and a/c was extremely noisy. We had just travelled 30+ hours so couldn't be bothered to move yet again but avoid room 1119 - luckily it was cool so we didn't have to have on overnight.
 Really comfortable bed, clean and conveniently across the car park was a WaWa which was a real plus. Friendly and helpful staff.

"We've been staying at the Wyndham, International Drive (previously the Marriott) for the last 25 years. Every time we've stayed we book the same type of room, a deluxe with resort views (it's called a resort so that should include all of the resort, including the gardens). Every time we've stayed we've been given a room with a balcony overlooking the gardens so booked the same type of room again this year. We only stayed overnight initially but are returning for five nights from this Sunday. Imagine our disappointment therefore, when enquiring if we could have our usual room when we return, we told that we had not paid for that type of room and we may not get a garden view as we always had in the past, without paying for an upgrade. As loyal customers to this hotel we are very very disappointed with what we have been told. Seems loyalty counts for nothing theses days. We are still hopeful they may give us our regular room but it has tarnished our opinion of them now.

"Our stay would�ve been nice but there were a few things that changed our mood. First, when we arrived to our it was hot and when we call front desk they acknowledged our issue and sent someone in. When the guy came to fix the air conditioner he seem rude towards us and thought we were lying about the temperature. Mind you he came into the room with a jacket and told us the room temperature was good and we disagreed since that is the reason we had him. He then made himself comfortable and stayed and we asked him if we needed him we would call the front desk and he chose to stay which made it uncomfortable for us since we just arrived and were tired. After a few minutes of us repeating the same thing he finally left. The next 2 days we had another issue with being locked out and then our rooms were not clean. We made the best of since we were tired but we were not happy with the outcome of each day at the hotel. I wish these issue had a different outcome. The location of the hotel is perfect. It literally has everything you need even the highway to the parks. Just wished it was a different outcome since this was a first family holiday getaway.

We were told to park in the street, y husband parked legally in front of someone�s house (not driveway) and they drilled a screw to his tires. So maybe paying the $25 would save the inconvenience or risk of vehicle damage. Aside from that everything was standard.

As a silver member, I was able to book the room for even cheaper than advertised, which was great. When I went to check in, that's when the receptionist let me know that there is an additional $30+tax per night for resort use, wifi, gym, and maybe something else too. It's a mandatory charge, even if I don't use the facilities. That was a bit disappointing, as I don't think this was mentioned on the website. Regardless, the overall price per night was very fair given the location and hotel, but I just wish the extra charges would've been more clearly defined.

"It was a little confusing when we drove onto the property. There was no parking on the street level, so we followed the sign for the underground garage. But once we got to the gate, saw we needed a room key to enter. So we backed up, and parked in handicap parking. I ran in to check-in. Thankfully the check-in process was quick. Once we got to the room, we noticed that the cabinet door that housed the mini fridge was broken. In the bathroom, the faucet was loose, and swiveled every time we turned the water on and off. Other than that, the overall stay was wonderful. Everyone especially enjoyed the rainfall shower head. Location was very convenient, as we were there to attend the Designer Con at the Anaheim Convention Center, which was only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel. Also, the when we first entered the room, it smelled really fresh and clean.

And if it was, it was not obvious. When I asked at the hotel what it was for, I was told it was for Wifi and business and recreation facilities. First of all, the Wifi was billed as 'free' and second of all, we did not use any of the business or recreation facilities. Apparently this doesn't matter. It is charged to everyone, regardless.

"Se trata de un Hotel que en l�neas generales recomendable, con el Madison muy cerca y no muy lejos de Empire, para acceder a Times Sqare se emplea 15/20 minutos a pie.
 Recepci�n hablan Espa�ol, las habitaciones est�n limpias si bien la m�a dispon�a de un ba�o peque�o.
 LO PEOR; para trasladarnos al aeropuerto un conserje del hotel nos ofreci� un servicio de transporte para 5 personas por un precio de 100 d�lares, cuando llegamos al aeropuerto un taxi oficial nos cobro 55 euros, y dado que llov�a en exceso y era muy complicado encontrar un taxi accedimos. Nos recogi� un veh�culo privado y nos llevo al aeropuerto y cuando llego la hora de pagar nos exige 120 d�lares a lo que le respondemos que nos hab�an dicho 100 en el hotel, a lo que argumenta que hab�a cogido la autopista , cosa incierta ya que nos es la primera vez que hac�amos ese trayecto y conocemos el paso por el control de la autopista, all� empieza un tira y afloja hasta que como siempre cedemos ANTE LA ESTAFA ya que se va el avi�n.
 
 Por tanto exijo al hotel que sea m�s serio a la hora de colaborar con taxistas sin escr�pulos que est�n solo para enga�ar al turista, eso si siempre y cuando el mismo hotel o personal de este no este en connivencia y ese exceso de pago realizado vaya directamente a sus bolsillos.
 
 Por �ltimo si llueve hay que salir del hotel al menos con horas de antelaci�n para llegar al aeropuerto y tener tiempo suficiente.

"The TRYP hotel was very disappointing. The lobby felt like a dormitory or a McDonalds. No place to sit. Room was dimly lit and decor strange but not at all in a cool old way. No place to put suitcases so they were on the beds. Housekeeping did not come until we called twice. Someone finally cleaned room around 5:30 pm. The pillows felt like someone had stuffed them with socks as they were very lumpy and very small. Coffee machine in room never worked. Somehow in this day and age they managed to find a TV without HD so picture quality was very poor. Towels were so scratchy they felt like sandpaper. It was a hard rain one morning but of course the hotel did nothing to offer umbrellas for their guests to use. Never ate anything there - can only imagine the food would be subpar. I would suggest you stay elsewhere.

"Stayed here for 3 nights. Room was ok. The nicest and newest thing in the room was the TV. The drawers on the dresser would not stay closed....push them shut and within seconds they would slide open...all by themselves!! The bed was ok...hard and firm but tons of pillows. HUGE GAP under the door that lets a nice chilly breeze into the room. Tons of lights inside and outside of the room. If you need it to be dark to sleep then bring some sunglasses cause the window shades do not close all the way and the curtains are to short! I would not choose to stay at this place again for what i paid per night but it served its purpose and i survived. UBER picks up from here and was awesome. The hotel restaurant is the jewel here...excellent food. I ate here every night and got something different. Each meal was 100% delicious.

"The room did not meet the expectations from the listing there was no coffee maker, though one was listed on the amenities. We asked for a coffee maker to be brought to our room after we checked in and by the end of our stay, none had arrived. We had to pay for our bags to be held after checkout, which in itself is ridiculous, and when we returned to retrieve them they told us what we paid was only half, the second half was required to take our bags. The bellman didn't accept credit card or allow us to charge the amount to our room. It was the end of our trip, and we weren't expecting to need more cash so we'd used our remainder to give our uber driver an excellent cash tip on the way back to the hotel. Had we known about the additional fee, we would have tipped using the app and saved the cash for this payment! Instead, we had to leave the hotel to go find an ATM, when we were already running late for the airport due to unexpected traffic delays. We had to go back into the storage unit to help the bellman find our bags because there was no organizational system! They were on an entirely different shelf from where he was looking! We wasted 45 minutes on this process when you consider that we had to wait in line for the bellman twice as he retrieved bags for other guests one at a time. We missed our flight by 3 minutes, as a result, which cost us hundreds of dollars! Additionally, the room was underwhelming. Only the lobby is luxurious, save your money.

"This hotel is very old and in poor shape. The rooms are musty with stained carpets. It used to be a Four Points - the shampoo dispensers in the shower were never changed out when it was converted. Another guest came to the front desk with a used rubber glove that was left behind in his room - likely from housekeeping, but still gross. I would not recommend this hotel at this price to anyone. The one up side was that the bed was comfortable.

The bathroom mirror light fixture was on the fritz and flickering constantly. the layout of the room was awkward with a cramped bathroom and lack of light in the long entryway. Check in was quick and easy, staff was courteous and friendly. Lobby/ hallways are sweltering while the elevator is way to cold. Might try somewhere else for our next trip but I do like this property and service.

The heater did not work in my room, which caused some discomfort. I came home late from work each night during my visit and did not have the energy to have someone come to fix the device in my room. There was an extra blanket and it got me through. Room service was friendly and prompt. The area is not the best place to be at night. My colleague walked in the evening to Denny's and 7-11 and was harassed in both locations. Again, I give this hotel higher ratings because the friendly and helpful staff. Additionally, the complimentary airport shuttle is much appreciated.

The only thing that ruined the stay is, the staff charged my credit card twice unauthorised, weird amounts I do not recognise. When i confronted the lobby, I was told I had to talk to the manager. I tried calling and writing e-mails. He never got back to me. I have involved Hotels.com in the situation, but may have to block the money at my bank. It is annoying as I really enjoyed my stay here.

Beautiful setting on a big lake and their numerous pools - including hot tubs and lazy river - are the main draw for us. Also like that they have a Starbucks in the lobby. Gym is nice and always clean. My only pet peeve is that they charge $22 a day for self-parking.

I had a question after we checked in and called the front desk, but no one ever answered. Parking is very challenging, you can hunt for street parking or pay $25 for valet service. Rooms are small (even a so called suite), but the beds are very comfortable and the view from our 10th floor room was great. The hotel is in a cute shopping area with a lot of restaurants and a busy night life vibe on a Saturday night. The complimentary breakfast was fantastic, with fresh scrambled eggs, sausage, and hash browns that were cooked perfectly. Cereal, bagels, toast, waffles, fresh fruit, coffee and juice were also available. The front desk service was my only complaint. We will likely stay here again.

Food was terrible along with poor service. We had 8:45p.m reservation, we got there at 8:30p.m checked in with them. Around 8:55p.m I walked up to ask how long and they told me � ah your table has been ready�. So why they didn�t call us? again poor service. The desert was uneatable �banana bread pudding�, no flavor, awful. The bathroom had mold on the bath curtains and on the wall. I�m surprised they have a 4 star ratings. I�m would give them a 2 .

"Loved this comfortable and elegant hotel. Really enjoyed the breakfast buffet in Tesoro Cove. Loved Deep Blu seafood grille, where they comped our desserts since we were there for our anniversary dinner - very unexpected and pleasant surprise. We got a family suite, with king bed, sofa and an alcove with a bunkbed. Our son loved that he had his own tv in the bunkbed alcove. Beds were very comfortable for my husband who has back problems. Pools were great, but I was otherwise unimpressed by ""children's activities"" which were nearly non-existent in the hotel. Just a tiny play area next to the pool of the hotel. They said there used to be an arcade in the hotel, but it was closed. They said we would need to go to the vacation club part of the resort to find arcades, playground and more pools, but our son was only with us 2 days in the hotel, so going to other parts of the resort didn't fit in our schedule. We were also surprised by the $22/day parking fees, which were not revealed on the hotels.com site. But overall, we would definitely recommend this hotel.

"I just spent a week at the New Yorker. The place has really gone downhill. At least half of the elevators were broken so wit times to go up and down were extremely long. The room cards constantly failed at both the room and the gym and I had to repeatedly go to the front desk to get new cards - and when I did the people at the reception glared at me like I was bothering them. The revolving door in the hotel lobby was malfunctioning constantly - it would suddenly stop and then star again and people kept getting whacked hard as they tried to negotiate their luggage through the thing to the street. There is no open wifi in the gym; there is a passworded wifi channel which you have to ask for but that doesn't work. Half of the hotel seems to have been converted into an urban dorm for nearby colleges, and that's okay but the kids are constantly getting onto the elevator and back out on another floor and it slows you down even further on top of the fact that half the elevators are broken. There are only two ice machines in the 40 floors and one of them was broken. This place needs a serious refurbishment (and probably new management).

Dette blev vi ikke informeret om, og Hotels.com var heller ikke blevet informeret. Vi var i timelang dialog med hotels.com om dette. Hotels.com var villige til at hj�lpe med relokation, det ville dog betyde vi skulle afse en dyrbar feriedag til dette Hotellet tilb�d at tilbagebetale differencen mellem v�relsespris p� et v�relse uden balkon. Dette endte vi med at tage imod, samt vi fik en voucher p� en fri nat ved hotels,com. Vi kunne dog have sparet tid og �rgrelser hvis dette var blevet informeret og ordnet inden ankomst, Desuden endte det med at blive meget dyrt i restaurationspriser, da vi ikke kunne benytte v�relsesfaciliteter/balkon til spisning som vi havde regnet med og h�bet p�, men m�tte i stedet ud i byen og spise hvert m�ltid. Det l�ber op i New York. Rooftop terassen/restauranten som der ogs� var reklameret med var ogs� lukket. S� alt i alt syntes vi ikke vi fik refunderet det �ndringen havde kostet os.

We went and dropped our stuff off in the room because we were going to a night time event at magic kingdom. We got back to the hotel room and went to get into bed and noticed the sheets apparently were not changed from the previous guests. It was past midnight so my kids slept on top of the blankets. It was disgusting also the window curtains and headboards had stains all over them. It was just a nasty place. We would not stay here again.

"For an older hotel, The New Yorker was nice. The Staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The room was clean. They very worst part of the hotel was the noise factor. We expected noise but not at that level. We were on the 27th floor, so we thought that would help with the noise. It felt like we were right on the 1st floor. We had to go and buy earplugs just to get to sleep. The hotel should invested in some kind of sound proofing. We have stayed in Times Square before and didn't have the horrible noise that we had at the New Yorker.

The agent asked if we wanted to upgrade to a bigger room with more than 1 bed. We are on a budget, so I said no, we would make due. She upgraded us at no cost because she thought we would not be comfortable. That was wonderful and so appreciated.

 They advertise parking butt charge you twenty five dollars a night. There is very very limited parking on the street.

 The staff doesnt tell you about any of the amenties they offer at hotel except for the breakfast and that written on a piece of paper tape to the front desk along with how to use the shower. I thought that was tacky to say the least.

El hotel esta descuidado, con las paredes de los pasillos manchadas y alfombras viejas. Puedo entender que deseen conservar su estilo vintage, pero le hace falta renovaci�n. La ventaneria de las habitaciones es antigua, por lo que, aunque nuestra habitaci�n estaba en el piso 21, se escuchaba todo el ruido de la calle. Sin embargo, creo que obtuve lo justo por lo que pagu�, y la ubicaci�n es realmente lo mejor.

"This hotel was amazing for our Honeymoon. From check-in to check-out, my husband and I had no complaints. We stayed for a week for our Disneyland adventures and this place was perfect. It's a 15 minute walk to the parks and downtown Disney. We were able to walk back to the hotel for a midday refresher and nap. This helped hugely. There's also a CVS, Walgreens, Starbucks, Pieology, Subway, and several food places within walking distance. The hotel room is equipped with a microwave and fridge, perfect for saving left overs and making quick breakfasts. There's also the Anaheim Garden Walk that has shops, restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory, and Bubba Gump that is literally only a 5 minute walk away. I cannot emphasize how convenient this all was. I would also like to give a huge shout-out to the front desk staff. Wonderful customer service though-out our stay. Their house-keeping also kept our room incredibly fresh and tidy each day. They have several amenities and no hidden resort fees. Outside is a gorgeous heated pool and spa tub that I wish we got more use out of. Lastly, their underground parking garage reassured us that our vehicle was safe and sound. Thank you for ensuring our honeymoon was memorable! :)

 The bar and restaurant were excellent!!! Excellent service and great food. We ate at the bar/restaurant both nights we stayed when we could have opted to go to a zillion other places.

This hotel resort has a grand 2-story mural of Queen Elizabeth I, over by the conference part of the resort; this is my favorite place to stay when we visit Orlando. Just be aware of the daily resort fee and self-parking is also at additional charge.

"The walls are paperthin and you can hear everything that is going on including street noise and talking in other rooms. The receptionist was not very friendly or welcoming when we arrived. When we checked into our rooms the cleaning staff was being very loud in the hallway and was shouting back and forth at eachother. When we came back to the hotel after dinner I could hear my neighbors shouting and having an argument saying ""Help, He's going to kill me!"" and screaming. I immediately went to the front desk and no one was there. I was afraid to go back to my room because of the shouting. The police were called and those people had to leave. The thermostat in my room did not work and the room stayed VERY COLD all night. I tried to switch it to heat and move the temperature up but it would not change. It stayed at 67 degrees all night. Overall it was not a good experience. I would not recommend.

My only complaint was the charge for luggage storage after check out. They charge$2 per bag. We were leaving them for 1 hour while we went to eat. We had just spent$1000 for a 3 night stay and then$8 more for 1 hour!!!! Ridiculous!!!! Left a very bad taste in my mouth. For that reason alone, we will never stay at The New Yorker again.

"The hotel's best asset was its location, close to Penn Stn. and an address I needed on 8th Ave. Long, slow line to check in. The 20th floor was dingy and scary, more like a tenament crime scene than a welcoming hotel. ""Art Deco"" means they haven't upgraded the place since the 20s. Room was small and barest minimum. Poor bed. A/C uncontrollable - awoke with a cold from the draft of the fan blowing onto the bed. Bath tub was nice, but amenities were stingy. Insulting, paying their rates, to have cheap, unremovable hangers, no breakfast AND pay a money-grab ""facilities fee"" on top. For what? Basically to ""use"" the hotel one has paid $300+ to sleep one night in. Unimpressed with WYNDHAM hospitality. MUCH BETTER, more luxurious stay at HILTON Embassy Suites two days later.

When I booked with Hotels.com, I thought I was getting a suite (probably not the fault of the property, but rather of the website) and upon arrival at the room, which is a half mile drive away from the front desk, we found a tiny motel room, with no tv remote that worked (so we had only one channel to watch!), a door that would not lock, and the dirtiest sidewalks imaginable. Then we discovered they charge a �resort fee� of $24 - I don�t think so! It was removed. Only two can eat for breakfast so prepare to pay for the kids!

 Clean and well maintained and quiet for a good night of sleep.

"If arriving via JFK consider taking the Skytrain and then line E of the subway to 34th St / Penn station - its as fast as a taxi and a sixth of the price. Rooms are ok size and clean - NYC is noisey so try and get a high up room at the front. In both the rooms we tried the A/C was very loud. Plenty of places nearby for breakfast, but the hotel�s looked fine. Well placed for exploring Manhattan on foot. Friendly staff, clean rooms - absolutely ok

He met us at the room and got all our bags in there for us. I told him I was dropping off my car to airport that night and he gave me instructions on how to get there. Picked me up from airport and we chatted all the way back to hotel. Like I said ... he was the shining star at the hotel! Room was clean one light didn�t work but overall a great one night stay.

"Photos made this hotel look very nice, but I felt like we were at a motel :( the tub had cracks and dirt in the corners and the air conditioner unit was extremely loud! It sounded like a plane taking off. Didn�t like that the curtains didn�t fully cover the ground floor windows, so it let a ton of light in, and depending on how they were positioned I could see people walking by outside. On the positive, the airport shuttle was easy and only took a few min to get to the airport.

"This place was terrible considering it was a Wyndham property. The room was the size of a postage stamp with barely enough room for the bed. We had booked for 3 days and a flight cancelation caused us to arrive the next day and even though I called the hotel ahead of time not asking for a refund our room was unavailable when we got there. The next day we get back late at approximately 1:30 in the morning and discover we had no housekeeping done that day. So at 1:30 in the morning we have to go down to the front desk to ask for towels and we were told that housekeeping does not clean the room unless it is requested. According to hotels.com this should have been included with the room as I have never heard of a regular hotel making you request housekeeping service. They had water coolers in the lobby and down stairs outside of the breakfast area that were never filled however you could buy a $2 bottle of water from a vending machine that they keep filled. The location of this hotel was also not very convenient if you are going into the city for tourism. I don't put that on them but it should be noted it's inconvenient

"This is a motel. Not at all the Wyndham we are used to! The floors were covered in sand, the beds were not clean and also had gritty stuff in between the sheets. The blinds don�t block out the light so you have car headlights coming in the window all night long. The motel is close to dining and bars, which is great other than the fact there are patrons outside LOUD and banging on the floors and up and down the stairs after 3am. I didn�t want to bathe my kids in the bath tub/shower, and that�s saying a lot after a whole day at Disney. The AC wouldn�t go lower than 75 and was struggling with even that temp even after midnight. We will not be visiting this hotel again, EVER. Spend the extra $25 and go to another hotel on I Drive to get a clean room.

"If you are thinking about getting the ""Breakfast Included"" option for this hotel- don't. They only provided fruit that wasn't even that fresh and a pastry. I was expecting better considering I payed and extra $10 for each person to get breakfast. If I hadn't gotten the ""Breakfast Included"" option, I could have gotten the continental breakfast for $12 which wouldn't have been half bad. Housekeeping was okay. The front desk was helpful in providing more toiletries and the room was okay. Wished it had better lighting and that the beds were actually queens and not fulls. It was a decent place to lay our heads at the end of the day. Liked that it was right next to two highways: to San Francisco and LA.

"The New Yorker has a beautiful lobby, central location and friendly staff, but that is where the charm ends. The rooms themselves are old and dingy. The windows really need to be replaced as they let in way too much noise. I was on an upper floor and while I understand that NYC is loud, double pane windows would go a long way and be a green initiative. The bathroom had peeling paint and no fan for moisture build up. The shower was very low, I am 5'5'', so anyone who is taller than that will have to stoop. There are weird stains on the curtains and a very firm old mattress for bed. The rooms are tiny but that would be okay if they weren't so dingy. I think this place survives due to the name, because tourists will flock to it, and the location. Otherwise, it is really not worth the price. The amenities fee is also a rip off, as there are very few amenities. They do not even have coffee in the rooms. I will stay somewhere else when I come back.

"My stay at this hotel was unacceptable. The first night the air conditioner broke around 10:30 at night. I called the front desk and they sent over an engineer to fix it. He was completely unprofessional and cursed in front of my 6 year old son when he made a mistake repairing the unit. The ac began leaking freon and we were told it was okay to stay in the room. After researching breathing in freon, I found out it can be toxic. The repair took around 40 minutes and we had to wait outside the room at 11pm. I called the front desk and they were completely unhelpful with the situation and they could not offer us another room. The next day my family returned to the hotel from being out all day and housekeeping failed to stock any towels in the room. I went to call the front desk and our phone was broken. While at the pool- there were zero pool towels stocked and ducks were swimming the the pool. The pool was filthy and the staff was completely unresponsive to the guests.

However, three issues 1) the first room which was in bldg 5 did not have a refrigerator which I was suppose to have so went to front desk to ask if I can be moved closer to the pool. They put me in bldg 8 not too far from the pool. However, my daughter saw bugs crawling on the bed we thought ok one or two but instead we moved the pillows and there were quit a bit. So we were disgusted went back to the front desk and showed them pics of the bug. They couldn�t move us because they were booked and said they will send someone. Maintenance saw the bugs and came to spray around both beds and said someone coming to change the linen. We were skeezed out we didn�t sleep well because of that 3) I went to use the laundry room in bldg 8 and I put like $6 dollars in coins and the washer did not work notified the front desk they told me to go to bldg 9/10 to wash and they reimbursed me $4 dollars. Also, the sink was clogging. Just a mess I was disappointed with the rooms never experienced that before.

"The front desk went missing for 20 mins and we had to wait without any apologies and no care. At the lobby bar, they let a man take off his sneakers and let him place them in the path of people leaving the elevators. The staff was unprofessional and slow.
 The room was spacious and new like in renovations.
 There was construction that happened at 7:30am in front of the building. If you want to sleep in, that will be a problem because of the noise level. The location is a shady and dangerous neighborhood. Beware walking at night and also it was a filthy street.

When we notified the staff they moved us into a smaller room that was dirty. There was trash in the bin and there was mold in the shower. The sink also needed to be cleaned. It looks like a beautiful hotel from the outside but overall we had a very bad experience.

No elevators and all room doors are facing outside. I had a huge gap under my door for any type of rodent to come in, put a towel under door. Carpets were not vacuumed much, had a toe nail and a regular nail on the carpet. Security came to my door the first night stating that the person below me said my smoke alarm was going off, I was dead sleep. Overall not the best stay and I will not be coming back.

We could barely walk in the room it was so small, the bathroom was made for children & the shower leaked all over the floor each time we showered. I told the staff several times & it really didn�t seem to phase them. So instead of drying ourselves off with the towels provided, we had to lay them on the floor to soak up the water. When asked if someone could come look at, they finally sent someone up the last night of our stay @12:30am after we got in from a concert. We won�t be staying her anymore

"Pros: Service charge included phone calls home 
 Cons: Rooms are too small
 Location: Location is good as it's easy to get to the main tourist points. Metro subway right outside door, Empire State Building a short walk (10 mins) Dinner attached (Tick Tock) offers good food Resort fees include unlimited phone calls to anywhere in the world as long as it's a land line which was a good addition. However, the rooms are very small, tiny bathroom and if like me you live out your suitcase be prepared to give up access to one side of the bed. Hotel is within walking distance of the Empire State and Macey's plus there is a metro station right outside. The $3 per bag charge for leaving your luggage on your last day is a bit steep. Over all a good stay and staff were very courteous.

"I still have mixed feelings about this hotel. 
 We arrived early on Saturday and were told they would call us when our room was ready -- they NEVER called and we went back around 4 or 5 and tons of people were checking in and going straight to their room. We re-checked in and were given absolutely one of the worst hotel rooms I have EVER been placed in. It was extremely small, around 100sq feet ?? Hot water was not working, old tv on a tiny counter, no room at all for luggage, no refrigerator, no coffee pot, no NOTHING!! Absolutely not worth the price of the room --EVER!!
 We sent in an online review that night and the manager called our room and told us she would have us switched the next day. However when doing what we were told to do the hotel staff was not aware of the request so that was another ordeal. 
 We were then told by the staff to come back after 4 and they would have a new room ready for us. We showed up around 4:30 and were told ""we were lucky because they just happened to have 1 room????""
  Well, I have a problem with this because we were told we would have a better room but now it was ""just our luck""?? The next room was much better! I do feel sorry for anyone paying the price and getting the room we had to begin with. 
 Location was a good central location for what we needed.
 If I need a good central hotel again I will consider staying here, but I will call directly to see what kind of room they are placing us in before hand.

"Stayed here for a family vacation, hotel was amazing, staff was amazing. Indoor pool was freezing so we couldn�t enjoy it. There wasn�t a fridge or microwave in the room but that didn�t spoil the vacation. Only downfall for this hotel was the fact parking was NOT free, which was a tough pill to swallow at checkin. We felt it should�ve be disclosed, I�ve rechecked my booking several times to verify, no mention of parking charges. So this should be rectified immediately in our opinion. Otherwise there is nothing wrong with this hotel, definitely would stay again!

"The hotel was clean and nice.
 There were group of people staying in multiple rooms who were loud all night.
 We had to call the front desk to send someone to ask them to be quiet at 12:30am.(The front desk acted like they had not heard them, which wasn't possible since the music was so loud that everybody could hear them)
 They were quiet for sometime and again at 3am they started getting loud.
 The only thing I wasn't happy with hotel management was, they did not take care of the situation until we called them.

"Seriously loved loved this hotel! I booked it on a whim (our go to was booked out) for our Disney stay, and not going to lie.. was a little worried - BUT this hotel, staff and overall everything went beyond our expectations! We arrived 2hrs before check in, and they still got us in no problem! The front desk staff have always greeted us with smiles, remembered us and our daughter and always made great small talk (you know that forced one is the worst.. but this was definitely not that!)! The rooms are so nicely remodeled and spacious! Good size bathrooms and the waterfall shower is amazing as well! Always cleaned on time, and always set up our daughters Disney stuffed toys on the bed and blanket for us to come back too! Long story short - you WILL NOT be disappointed here at all! I can honestly say this hotel is now our favorite and we will only stay here! Thank you guys for making our trip smooth :)

 As we walked in to the toom, it seem dirty and dump smelling odors, we put our bags down and if we went to seaworld to make the most of our time.
 We got back to the room at midnight and our 5 year son was a sleep in the car ride, I put him down in the bed and noticed alot of Ants between the sheets. I quickly removed him and shake the ants of the bed, and we noticed the whole room was infested by ants.i called the front office spike to him explain out concern. He sad he will. Send someone over.. 30-40 min later I called again.and again.was told we will send someone over.. nothing g again. I called to ask for different sheets. And they decided to hung up on us and never picked up the phone again. Finaly at 120 a guy give us 4 new sheets and we had no choice but to spend the night in uncomfortable room full of ants and it was the worst experience ever and we will never return to Wyndham again.

The young man that can to fix the problem change the sheets 3 times before he found some clean ones at this point we�ve been standing for a hour it�s now almost 1am so the chair in the room was nasty I wouldn�t let a animal sit on it they tried to hide it by flipping the pillow. So my Neice was in a twin bunk bed it had left over hair from another human but what took the cake was it had BLOOD all on the inside railing so she wasn�t comfortable so I called Hotels.com and they talked to nite managers of going on 2am which put us in another room 3rd move by this time were to tried to go anywhere else but when we left out for the day came back we could smell the mildew in the room.

"we came there with another family and reserved 3 rooms and requested to be on either the same floor or next to each other. well neither one happened and the other family that we were with had to get a separate room because including there 3 children they had a total of 5 guests and required to get two rooms which they did. However there kids room were on the opposite side of the hotel then they were despite complaining they said they were sold out and couldn't bring the kids room closer. I mean seriously these kids are 6, 10 ,and 12 they need adult supervision. Basically they each had to sleep in one room. 
 As for our room we were facing a stone wall and what we had a view of was hundereds of cigarette buds from the balconies above us. 
 
 again were not accomodating so we called orbitz and had them refund our money and reserved another hotel the next day...

The location of the hotel is awesome too. Everything you need is within walking distance. I would definitely recommend. Another thing to note, for people wary of New York City, is that the security is excellent. They don't allow anyone, who isn't staying at the hotel, past the lobby (24/7).

"This hotel has nasty old carpet in the rooms, old beds that NEED TO BE REPLACED! That is a health hazard. For hotels in the San Jose area, with the market being such as it is, and prices for stays in the area being so high; hotel owners should be making enough money to have their hotels in ship shape if they are going to carry a brand name like Wyndham.

"The hotel was fine with only two floors, but be forewarned that there's no elevator whatsoever to take you to the upper level. If you're loaded down with heavy bags as we were, it was a trek to maneuver just to get to where our room was and we had to get assistance. If this poses any issue whether you're a senior, have mobility issues or otherwise, you might seriously want to reconsider this choice. There's a few mediocre eating places nearby in walking distance, but it looks more like a business area.

"I booked this room to be close to the San Jose airport and for my boys to enjoy the pool on out last day of vacation. The hotel lobby and hallway stank. It was also very loud (not hotel's fault I guess). The pool was so murky and nasty that my boys did not even want to go in - which is unbelievable since they both LOVE to swim. I was expecting more from a Wyndham hotel. I wish I had spent my money elsewhere. It was disapointing to end our vacation on a sour note.

My family and I had been on the road all day and was exhausted. The staff member act as if the check in was confusing and begin to get frustrated. This facility need to work on there staff customer services skills. Secondly the bed cover on the bed had soil spots, management was notified and phoned for someone to change the sheets. My family and I went to dinner. When we arrived back to the room , the sheets still were not changed.
 The Wyndam is nice , im not going to down grade the hotel. Our stay was not a complete disaster, one of the staff members accommodated my children for the extended wait time, some of the staff were friendly and helpful. The location is right off the freeway, there is a trail nearby , and stores within 5 minutes.

"I like that they cleaned our room everyday day. I also liked that it had a refregidare. But being a family oriented hotel it should have a small microwave, in the rooms, because when you have little ones it wasnt a good idea to have to walk to the lobby to heat up some food for them. I dislike that the parking available was very limited when events are held. I believe that you should have an assigned parking with your stay. Also the event that was there was very loud in the pool till about 2 in the morning and they were loud, there should be a limit to that. The action were unfair to young ones around and the pool couldnt be access for 3 days. Also they should have a well established kiddie pool area with sprinklers or something fun because not all kids can enjoy the big pool. Also a long time ago there were floats available and games to play on the premises at the pool. Aside from that the staff and place was nice.

"The hotel was beautiful, but rooms could�ve been more clean. Housekeeping never cleaned the bath tub, changed our sheets one time during a 4 night stay, never refilled our bath linens, and everything was dusty. Headboards had scratches and tears. Only one phone worked. No microwave in room. Glasses for drinks were only changed out once. Carpenters working on upper floors early in the morning due to remodeling. When booking through Expedia, there is no mention of the resort fees and parking fees. Total resort fee was $75 for 4 night stay plus $22.95 per night for parking. There is no other option for parking. My card was charged $375 upon arrival for deposit. 20% was added to room service which is of course pricey. Upon check in we were told our room with one bed was booked, but they had another room with two king size beds. Not a problem, but I want what I paid for. Too many hidden fees for too many issues and the staff really treats it as a minor inconvenience, but for the amount I paid I expect a clean room and better service. The staff members were very kind, but I feel as though they didn�t take our complaints seriously and I felt our complaints were pretty legitimate. Looks can be deceiving.

The hotel is old and rundown, and the front desk service was subpar and flat out rude. I am frequently in NYC and every time stay in midtown manhattan, and would never stay again at this hotel!! The hotel gives Wndyham a bad name and I would think twice before using a Wyndham hotel in the future. There are several other hotels I have stayed in the area and all of them are far superior to this place! Do not stay here you will be severely disappointed! Good location however, just very poor all around other than that!!!

 - Room 153 -- Needs to be check the AC
 Other than that ... the rest kinda fair - OK -

"I rarely post reviews but felt it necessary to post about our recent stay. Pictures are deceiving! I expected a clean, spacious room. What we encountered was a musty room with stained bed skirts and stained comforter on one of the beds. The furniture is old and instead of drawers there are cubbies to store your clothes. Although I called for hangers since there were none, they were never delivered so we bought some at the nearby RiteAid. The safe gave us problems and we had to call for service twice (they were prompt in responding for the safe). Although there were four of us, only two towels were provided and after calling three times for additional towels, it took them over a half hour to bring them since ""they were still drying"". After the first day we wanted to check out but thought we were really only there to sleep and even with that thought, I felt even the basic amenities were lacking. Two positives: great water pressure and the beds/pillows were comfy. Staff were friendly but I highly doubt if we will return to this hotel.

When I got there was surprised that I had to pay for parking because they have no lot, $25 day is pricey for a stay there, however, the valets were wonderful and there was absolutely no wait time for car. Ultimately it was a benefit instead of an irritant. My room was dirty when I arrived but to be fair to the hotel, they were cleaning when I arrived. I arrived at check-in time so I was surprised the room was dirty. When I called front desk, I got immediate response n room was cleaned. I am a neat/clean freak so I this was the only issue for me.

On the negative side: the hallway smelled like pot, spots on the carpet, not a comfortable bed. Our room was on the freeway side of the hotel and it was noisy throughout the night. There was a lot of noise from guests in the hallway as well. Breakfast for us was included and it tasted good and had good service. If it is not included in your booking, it would be overpriced.

Our reservation included the breakfast buffet, which we looked forward to every day. On Friday night, there was a convention going on and I could not find parking anywhere near our room. So, I drove to the entrance and a very helpful and kind attendant led me to a parking area in his golf cart and then drove me back to our building. He remembered me the next morning and knew exactly where my car was. His friendly service is a testament to the way the hotel is run. A big thank you to the Wyndham Resort for our stay - we'll be back.

"My fianc� and I booked this hotel for our anniversary and for the location. When we arrived we were tacked on an $80 resort fee which was in the tiny tiny small print. Breakfast was $16 per person. We had to park on top of a hill in between trees, due to an anime convention that weekend. Illicit drug use by the pool, and security did nothing. We had blood stained comforter, and house keeping didn�t do anything. At the bar in the lobby, the bartender added another dollar on top of what i tipped because their �policy� adds another dollar for manual tips added to a credit card receipt. Called service and was rudely treated and transferred to a manager on a Sunday. Obviously they aren�t there. Called back and was yelled at and mistreated. The worst experience I�ve ever had.

"This property, on the outskirts of San Jose, is readily accessible to Silicon Valley and beyond by several convenient freeway on-ramps. The staff was extremely kind, patient, and helpful. The televisions in the first two rooms I was assigned did not work. The carpet was badly stained in the third room (249), where I decided nevertheless to remain. The furnishings in all rooms are well past fully-depreciated, a bit banged-up, and oddly mismatched. WiFi was spotty. The pool and spa were welcome but could use a good scrub around the edges. Clientele was varied, from retired people to families to laborers. Quiet neighborhood. The restaurant across the parking lot offered good variety and quality.
